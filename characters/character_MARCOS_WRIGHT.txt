Name: Marcos Wright
Age: 25
Background: A panther shifter, he works at Franc's club Velvet as a bouncer. He used to be upset with Caden, but when he found out Caden was a detective and actually a good guy, he got over it. He's one of the five guys in Sera's posse. His mother died when he was young and his father was never around, so the posse is his family of choice and he would ride or die for them.
Lives: In a tiny apartment because he mostly hangs out at work or the gym.
Romantic: He's been single for a while, but is deeply in love with Sera and wants to claim her for his own.
