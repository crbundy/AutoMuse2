Emrys. You marked both of us without permission. I'm sure it's not intentional, but it's you being a jerk, either way."  Sighing, Franc ran his hand through his hair. "I'm sorry. It's just that I can't help the way I feel. Like I'm being compelled by the gods to claim both of you." "I understand that," Sera replied. "But it doesn't change my feelings about it. You don't get to claim me or Emrys without our permission. Yeah, I'm attracted to you, Franc. You're a sweet guy, and even though we haven't known each other long, I feel safe with you. I do want to get to know you better. I don't know about Emrys, but he seems to feel the same way." Emrys glanced over at Emrys, who was looking at Sera with a hunger in his eyes. Emrys felt the same way. He wanted to explore Sera, to discover every inch of her, to claim her as his own. "I do want to get to know you better as well, Franc. But I'm also with Emrys. I'm sorry, but right now I'm really not up for sharing you with him. I'm not sure I'll ever be again. That's not to say it would be a deal breaker if you apologized and made things right with us. I just need some time to sort things out.
