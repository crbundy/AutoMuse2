Premise: Sera was so angry with Franc for his use of his demi-god powers to mark her as his mate that she told him that she can't be his mate and he had to undo what he had done. Franc put his hand on Sera's arm, and the mark disappeared. "You should talk to him about this," Sera said to Emrys. Emrys looked at the mirror, wondering if the scorpion was his and if he should seek it out. He saw himself and Sera in the mirror, and he knew it was his. He walked to the mirror and touched it, and both he and Sera disappeared from the temple and reappeared in the mirror. Franc was there waiting for them. The golden scorpion on the mirror wall disappeared, and in its place was a mirror with a beautiful reflection of the three of them together.
