This section is told from Emrys Tedros' point of view. Emrys and Sera are shocked to see Taneisha's magical portal has disappeared and they are on their own in the desert. Emrys recognizes this place as an ancestral land of his people, and they walk toward ancient stone buildings not far from them for shelter. Emrys asks how Sera is doing. Sera is angry with Franc after his use of his demi-god powers marked her as his mate. Emrys shares that all the guys feel the same way. They reach the building, which Emrys recognizes as an ancient temple, and go inside, grateful for the releif from the heat of the desert sun. They look around the mysterious temple and find the space is filled with mirrors hanging from the stone walls which reflect everything except for Emrys and Sera. In each mirror there is a golden scorpion, but which one belongs to Emrys? Emrys tries to grab one, and the scorpion disappears, transporting both Emrys and Sera into an idyllic future where they are together, just the two of them.
