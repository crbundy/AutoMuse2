sleeve. The panther shifter relented, and I let out the breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding. We kept our pace up the trail as we neared the last of the switchbacks. “The trail flattens out up ahead when we reach the river.” “Let me guess,” Franc replied. “We get to cross it?” I nodded. “Yes, assuming we want to keep going up.” “Can’t say I do, but it’s the task ahead of us,” Sera said. She turned to me. “Tell me about this legacy of yours that’s so cool that a mythical bird man steals it from faery and flies it to the top of a mountain.” I sighed. What to share? What to hold back? When I’d waffled long enough, Liam spoke up. “Caden’s family legacy is a small vase full of seeds which he temporarily liberated from his granny,” Liam said. “I gave him crap about just showing off some seeds, but it appears those little grains were actually worth something.” “That’s gracious of you, wolf,” I snapped back. Liam gave me a little bow with a flourish. “Jackass,” I whispered, knowing he would hear me. “What seeds?” Sera asked me, ignoring our banter. “They’re from the huppulu tree, which is sacred to my kind,” I explained. “They are a symbol of a time when demons held power, not just in the Netherworld, but in the human world as well.” “It’s like the strength and pride of your ancestors,” Sera said. “I bet granny’ll be pissed you lost them?” I gritted my teeth. Sera had no idea. “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Granny Lily on a demon-fueled tirade.” She let out a weak laugh.
