hair. “Crap. I must have transformed the water? Or maybe I released something out of the river?” I blinked a few times, trying to make sense out of Sera’s words. “You don’t know what happened?” She shrugged, a timid half-smile playing across her face. “It’s your magic. How can you not know?” I blurted out, my words louder than I intended. “I just don’t, okay?” Sera crossed her arms, hugging her midsection. “My magic has never been what you would call reliable. Sometimes when it kicks in, things go a little sideways.” “But they pulled you from Goldenbriar because you needed private tutoring,” I replied, my mind putting together the puzzle pieces as the words flowed out of me. “You needed the tutor not because you were exceptional, but because you weren’t good enough?” Sera sighed, tapping her index finger on her nose. “I’m a powerful mage, but my magic is unstable. Volatile. So I’ve learned to keep my powers locked down and unused, lest things go haywire. But I felt like I had to fight off the ghouls to save Marcos from the river. I had to act, despite the danger.” Sera’s revelation hit me like a slap to the face. She’d lied? Surprised at the depth of my reaction, I took a step back. Did I really have a right to feel betrayed by her evasion? But no, examining my feelings, I realized that wasn’t the entirety of my upset. Caden’s raised brows were his textbook ‘I did not see that one coming’ look, but watching Liam’s and Marcos’ expressions, I realized this wasn’t news to them.
