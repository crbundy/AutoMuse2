wait to travel until daylight, we’ll likely avoid more encounters with the undead.” “Can ghouls jump this high?” I asked Caden. Caden shrugged. “No clue, but we have to assume it’s possible. Let’s hope no others show up, but we’ll have to keep watch through the night to make sure.” “Here’s some burn cream,” Franc said, holding it out to Marcos, who took it and began applying a thin coating to his burns.  “I’ll take the first watch,” Marcos said. “It’s not like I can sleep until this heals a bit.”  “I’ll sit with you,” Liam said. “I’ve got too much adrenaline pumping anyway to sleep for a while.” “I don’t imagine I can sleep either,” I said, followed by a yawn. Taking a moment to check in with my body, I realized how exhausted I felt, even though my mind was still running in circles. A chill ran over my skin, and I remembered I was still in wet shoes and pants. “Besides, it’s too cold.” “Doesn’t help you’re still in wet clothes and shoes. Here, I found some blankets and extra sets of clothes,” Caden replied. “C’mon, let me show you.” Caden led me deeper into the cave to a flat area where he’d layered a couple of thin blankets to form a rudimentary sleeping pallet. I pulled off my shoes, socks, and pants.  “Here, try these on for size,” Caden said. He handed me some leggings and fresh socks, which I tried out. I rarely slept in clothes, but as this cave didn’t come with a heater, I’d adapt. Caden took my wet clothes and hung them over rocky outcroppings on the cave wall to dry.
