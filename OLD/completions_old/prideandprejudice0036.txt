with       the officers.—Yours ever,        “CAROLINE BINGLEY”        “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell       us of _that_.”        “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”        “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.        “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems       likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”        “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure       that they would not offer to send her home.”        “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to       Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”        “I had much rather go in the coach.”        “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.       They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”        “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”        “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s       purpose will be answered.”        She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the       horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on       horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many       cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane       had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were       uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued       the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not       come back.
