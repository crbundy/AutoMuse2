PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: until I felt the heat of his breath against my cheek. Instead of kissing me, he brushed a finger across my lips. One of these days, Im going to show you the freedom of letting your inhibitions run wild. Uncap that magic flowing through your veins. He spoke slower, hovering just millimeters from me. He trailed his fingers down the bare skin of my arms with the lightest of touches. Show you whats possible when youre not bottling up every. Little. Spark. I gasped, hungry for air from the breath I didnt realize Id been holding.    Peaches and Cream Sera One moment I was about to kiss Franc and the next a whirlwind hit me again, tossing me from Francs arms without a hint of warning. No! I yelled, clenching my hands into fists. That conversation couldnt be over. Franc and I hadnt settled anything. Now I stood in the middle of a gourmet-outfitted kitchen, which was even messier than Francs library room had been. Sounds like a terrible trip? came Cadens silky voice from behind me. I whirled around, finding Caden dressed only in a black bib apron. Unidentified confections adorned his skin and apron. The words Master Chef were emblazoned across the fabric in bright white, only just legible from the smears of flour, or was it confectioners sugar, dusting the garment?  Ready for a taste test? he purred, waving like a game show host to two bowls in front of him. I couldnt help but smile just a little. Caden looked so ridiculous and adorable, it was hard not to. Why
