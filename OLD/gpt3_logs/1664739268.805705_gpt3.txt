Passage: Whatever. Ill be out front when you guys, and gal, need me. Which I know, is always.  Id hand it to him. The incubus might have a knack for finding trouble, but lacking in confidence, he was not. Now, what can I do you for? Jasper asked. Were looking for something and were told you might know about it, I said. Its called the Eye of the Tiger. Jasper set down the shoe he was polishing and crossed his arms. Are you now? he asked, the tone of his voice challenging them. Em, Sera, and I exchanged cautious glances, but it was Sera who answered Jasper. Yes, an associate of ours asked us to see about acquiring it for her. Do you still have it? A sly grin spread across Jaspers wizened face. He looked at each of us again, as if he was measuring our mettle. Yeah, I do. Without turning around, he pointed to a glass case to his right full of bowling balls.  Only then did I notice the one in the center, the only one without a price tag. It was a little smaller than the other balls, but its tiger-stripe colors swirled and moved, iridescent and casting a barely noticeable glow.  Is that a bowling ball? I asked. Jaspers disappointed frown was my answer. Heck no, but it looks mighty fine in there. Dont cha think? Its a truly impressive specimen, Sera answered him, her voice full of praise. Standing up on the balls of her feet, she leaned on the counter to get a better look at the Eye. My attention was drawn not to the orb, but to the shapely curve of her ass bent
