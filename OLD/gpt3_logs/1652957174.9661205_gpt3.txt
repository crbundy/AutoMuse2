Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world and has adventures. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world rather than return to the real world. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. The caterpillar tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her. The Pigeon is complaining about the serpents, and Alice is trying to explain that she is not a serpent. The Pigeon is not convinced. Alice comes across a house in a clearing and wonders how to get to the garden. She is hesitant to approach the house because she doesn't want to frighten whoever lives there. She eventually decides to approach the house and is greeted by two footmen. One of the footmen has a letter for the Duchess, which Alice is curious about. The Footman tells Alice that it is useless to knock on the door because he is on the same side as she is. He also says that there is so much noise going on inside that no one would be able to hear her anyway.
