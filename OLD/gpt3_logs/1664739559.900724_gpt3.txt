PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: hair care, but not all of them smelled promising. I took a guess with one that smelled of vanilla and honeysuckle and had a texture like conditioner, working that through my long locks.  While waiting for the conditioner to work its magic, I aimed the shower head at the space between my shoulders and zoned out for a while.  A tapping at the door roused me from my reverie. Yeah? I said, my mind snapping to attention, remembering the four supe men on the other side of that door. The door swung open, and Franc stepped in, closing it behind him. His gaze held mine, his presence taking up considerable real estate in the bathroom, making me feel like he was standing right here beside me. You look like youre enjoying yourself. Somehow, I didnt feel at all self-conscious in front of the demi-god. Perhaps it had been the days in close quarters together? Or was it knowing hed already seen me naked?  I swear this hideaway is a pocket of paradise in hell, I said, rinsing the conditioner out of my hair. His grin widened. Are you planning to share this paradise or are you going to hoard all the hot water for yourself? Im no monster, Franc. I teased as I studied him leaning against the wall. For a god of ecstasy, youre showing a lot of restraint right now. I scrubbed at my scalp with my fingertips, feeling the silky bubbling of the water cascade down my body and over my breasts, bobbing with every motion. Franc was still as stone when he answered. You cant force ecstasy,
