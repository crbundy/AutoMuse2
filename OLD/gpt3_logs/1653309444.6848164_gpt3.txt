PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: The passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family. The passage discusses the relationship between an artist and their art, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography. The artist in the passage argues that this is not the case, and that art should be separate from the artist's personal life. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The mind of a well-informed person is like a bric-a-brac shop, full of dust and monsters, the author says. They think that their friend has changed and become less attractive to them. Oscar Wilde's character is pleased to have avoided a dull lunch conversation about the virtues of thrift and hard work by instead staying with his friend. He then has a sudden realization about where he had heard the name "Dorian Gray" before.
