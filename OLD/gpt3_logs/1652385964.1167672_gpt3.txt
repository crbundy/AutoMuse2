Passage: _tolerable_.        I beg you would not put it into Lizzys head to be vexed by his       ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last       night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once       opening his lips.        Are you quite sure, maam?is not there a little mistake? said       Jane. I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.        Ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and       he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very       angry at being spoke to.        Miss Bingley told me, said Jane, that he never speaks much       unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is       remarkably agreeable.        I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very       agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how       it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare       say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,       and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.        I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long, said Miss Lucas,       but I wish he had danced with Eliza.        Another time, Lizzy, said her mother, I would not dance with       _him_, if I were you.        I believe, maam, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with       him.        His pride, said Miss Lucas, does not offend _me_ so much as       pride
