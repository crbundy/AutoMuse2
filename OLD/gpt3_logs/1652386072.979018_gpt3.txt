PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.  You see, remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?  Where, indeed?  It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a womans dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.  Where, then?  Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business

Concise Summary:

==========

RESPONSE:

The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer.
