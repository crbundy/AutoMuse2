PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: tight. Dont you ever do that again, little mage. He shuddered as he took a deep breath, his nose buried in my hair. His desire to keep me safe was endearing. Im okay, Marcos, really. Were all okay, thanks to Cadens sacrifice. Marcos pulled away from me, only to have Liam draw me into his arms next.  I dont know what Id do if we lost you, he whispered in my ear.  I hugged Liam back, my palms sliding along the bare skin of his back. But you didnt, and Im not going anywhere. But you can put some clothes on now that were out of danger. He chuckled, but then did just that. Taneisha strode back through the portal, closing it after herself and cutting off the lamentations of the Anzu in the Netherworld. She sauntered over to a throne-like chair, her gown of stars trailing behind her as if she were in some sort of fashion show. Marcos walked up to Caden and held his hand out. I misjudged you, brother. What you did today? What youve been doing for your job undercover? Youre a stronger man than I ever realized. If I were in your shoes, I dont think Id have been able to persevere. A look of sorrow passed over Cadens face. I wondered if he was thinking about how working undercover had damaged his relationships? At least now they had an opportunity to reset and move forward. He took Marcos hand and then pulled the panther shifter in for a hug. Its okay. I didnt exactly give you a reason to think better of me. Im sorry I left you in the dark. Marcos chuckled.
