Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: eyed gaze boring into me. Id said that out loud? I felt my cheeks heat. Maybe Id muttered and his shifter ears had picked it up? Oh nothing, I was just thinking about work.  Argh, I wanted to slap myself in the forehead. I was grateful when the conversation moved on. About time you got back, Franc said, walking over to us. He was an imposing figure. Lean and tall with sky-blue eyes, blonde, and clean shaven, hed always reminded me of a Viking warrior, despite his Dionysian lineage. We thought you wouldnt make it, he said to Emrys, his voice terse. Emrys checked his watch and then shrugged. Were here in time. Besides, Sera and I had to catch up a little. As you can see, she came along and has offered to reason with Tink on our behalf. Franc tilted his head to the side and looked me over. It might help. Thanks for coming along. Youre welcome, I replied. Liam, a wolf shifter, and Marcos, a panther shifter, shared a look, and then both frowned deeper. I remembered their habit of silent communication, something innate to shifters, and wondered what they werent saying aloud. Caden, an incubus, gestured towards me, shaking his head. Shes your big solution? he said to Emrys, but then looked at me. No offense or anything, Sera, but Em shouldnt have involved you. Despite Cadens tone, I couldnt help the tingle of pleasure that washed over me when he spoke. I glanced at his neck, seeing the silvered chain that hung there and relaxed. I remembered him wearing it
