Passage: divine fire to keep you going. Marcos nodded. Yeah. Just a little. I dont know why Im so exhausted. I sighed with relief. Well figure it out, but in the meantime, here you go. I kept my hand firm on his backpack and leaned closer, pressing my lips against his cheek. I said a silent prayer, an invocation of Dionysos, and a blessing to Marcos body and mind. The power rushed through me, swirling around us like a sudden but brief tempest. I pulled back, watching him closely. Id aimed for a minimal effect, but everyone reacted to the madness of Dionysos differently. Marcos shuddered as the power washed over him. When he opened his eyes, they sparkled with a joy of life I felt mirrored in my very soul. Ive never let you do that before. Theres a first time for everything. I could feel the power of my gods lineage surging through his veins. My power couldnt heal, but the consciousness shift was often profound, sometimes leading to a new way of viewing the world that lasted for some time. Doesnt have to be the last, either. How are you feeling? He flexed his arms, a self-assured smile spreading across his face. Already his pallor had improved. Like I could run up a mountain? I smiled. Theres time for that later.

But when he adjusted his holds on the wall, it was with a surety hed lacked a few moments
