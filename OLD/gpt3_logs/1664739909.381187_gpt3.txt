Ugh, maybe I had? No, its just, why would you want to commit? You throw nightly bacchanals at your club, basically. Why would you want to be tied down? Franc sighed and frowned, regarding me with a distinct air of disappointment. No wonder your magic is so fickle. Youre stuck on preconceived limits and full of nos. Huh? What you need is a possibility mindset, ma chre. Instead of all the reasons things wont or cant work, consider starting with the goal. The hope. The vision of inspiration. You really like to hear yourself talk, dont you? All the dreams in the world wont make something possible. I suppose I do, but I also suppose thats what happens when theatrical performance runs literally in your blood. Franc brought his mouth close to mine
