PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: it. Youve changed since the academy, wolf. Back then you were all brooding and intense. Now youre still brooding but also somehow, chill. What happened? Ha. Ha. Funny kitty. A lot has happened, but that story will have to wait. Liam growled, his eyes abruptly flashing yellow and focusing on the shed.  A wave of foreboding washed over me, followed by an urge I couldnt quite name. I wanted to fight. To fuck. Maybe both. Somethings wrong. We rushed back to the shed, side by side. I burst in through the door, Liam hot on my heels. Waves of mage fire whipped at my fur, the scent of my own singed fur stopping me in my tracks. Wed come face to face with Sera, sitting cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by her own mage fire.  Her expression brought fear into my heart. Panic etched Seras features, and there was an air of desperation to her scent. Mage fire had massive destructive power, and the mage wielding it was usually immune to the effects. The floor around Sera was singed, as were the stack of benches behind her. With the amount of flame surrounding her and the blistering char of the wood, I figured we were moments away from the building catching fire. Liam was the first to shift back, and I joined him a moment later. We kept our distance, standing just outside of the nimbus of Seras fire. Liam handed me my pants and then pulled his jeans on while I did the same. Although we shifters are comfortable without our clothes, now was not the time for it. Hows it
