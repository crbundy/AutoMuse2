Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: light was dim; the air smelled faintly of brimstone, and someone, or someones, limbs splayed out over me. If only I could say this was an unfamiliar experience.  But then, with a jolt, our present situation slammed into my mind. I remembered how the mage, Sera, had curled up against me. As an incubus demon, I was used to the arousal I elicited from others simply by existing. My charmed necklace muted, but didnt fully block my demonic abilities, meaning my powers wouldnt overwhelm those around me. Yet when people touched me, my powers became difficult to resist. Which was why Id expected Sera to initiate sex, but she didnt. Instead, shed sought my comfort, of all things, in this hellish landscape. That guileless act softened my heart to her, despite her being a mage. Then shed fallen asleep, asking nothing more than my touch and the heat of my body against the nights chill. Id followed her to dreamtime not long thereafter, eager to claim a few hours of needed rest, despite my desire to bury myself in her flesh. Now, all of my attention was focused on the way Sera pressed her thigh against my erection, grinding as she let out a breathy moan. Under the thin blanket, I saw Franc run his hand up Seras leg, resting it on the curve of her hip as he gently kneaded her flesh through the thin fabric of her leggings. I looked up and my gaze met his. From the familiar, heated look in his eyes, I knew I wasnt the only one sporting a hard on. I brushed Seras hair out of her
