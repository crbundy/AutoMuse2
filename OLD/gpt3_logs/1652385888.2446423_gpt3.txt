Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.  Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.  My dear, she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill youd of thought she had my appendicitis out.  What was the name of the woman? asked Mrs. McKee.  Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at peoples feet in their own homes.  I like your dress, remarked Mrs. McKee, I think its adorable.  Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.  Its just a crazy old thing, she said. I just slip it on sometimes when I dont care what I look like.  But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,

RESPONSE:

Mrs. Wilson is a woman who is very proud of her husband's photographic work. She has recently changed her outfit to a cream-coloured dress and her personality has changed as well. She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it.
