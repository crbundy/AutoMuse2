Im glad youre okay, and I appreciate the affection, but you can put me down, Marcos, Sera said. Marcos I never want to put you down, little mage. I want to lose myself in you until I cant remember what day it is anymore. Im confident youve already lost track of the time, Liam said, shaking his head. How long will his god-drunk episode last? he asked me. Maybe a couple of hours?  Caden had almost reached our side, and I held out a hand to him, helping to steady him as took the last step and joined. He got to work untying his rope, while Liam stood and coiled his end. I pulled off my backpack, stretching my shoulders after hauling it around all day long. Marcos groaned, still leaning against Sera. I want to dive right in into you and taste every inch of your skin. I want your scent all over me and mine all over you. Sera flashed Marcos a sultry smile. Do you? she said, arching her brow. She took his face in her hands, forcing him to look her in the eye.
