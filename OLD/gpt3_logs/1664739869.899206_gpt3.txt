PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: smell of coffee and muffins. Love the nerdy patrons. I even love the late nights. But you know how that is, right? You love Velvet, dont you? Franc raised his brows. I adore Velvet. You really have to visit us sometime. During working hours, that is. Im not sure your swanky club is quite my jam, Franc, I frowned. But I appreciate the invitation. When you visit Velvet, I guarantee it will be your jam, he said. I ask about your shop because I know you can leave here. Taneisha offered to return you home, yet you remain with our posse in her trap. Why? I shifted in his embrace, wondering whether to escape his touch or his question. I wasnt sure. Maybe both? I dont feel right leaving the posse to the faes whims. Multiple times now Ive been able to help your situation. I dont want things to get worse for you if I leave. His smile deepened. Pure altruism? Youre a rare gem, mage Seraphina Lowe. Was he making fun of me? Uh, thanks? Im just doing what any other decent person would do. Francs fingers ran up my spine, sending chills rolling up my back. So then, anyone would let me fuck them in the shower, just to be decent and reasonable? Well, certainly not! That was just us letting off some steam and pent-up frustrations after tromping through the Netherworld. Steamy on multiple levels. His words were light, but Francs mood had cooled a few degrees. When he spoke again, his tone was sharp. And would anyone consider letting not one, but two shifters
