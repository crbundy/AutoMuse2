We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  Ive got a nice place here, he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.  It belonged to Demaine, the oil man. He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. Well go inside.  We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through
