He squinted his eyes like he had a headache. You mean the other four? Cause Im right here. Whatever, panther boy, I taunted him. Marcos moved a step closer, and I knew it was now or never.

I dragged Jax around Marcos and through the exit with me, flicking my fingers to open a portal just steps outside of the club. We passed through and I closed the portal before anyone could follow, leaving Jax and I alone in a fog of petal rain in a secluded park down the street from my place. We both took a few moments to catch our breath. Jax let out a giggle. That was amazing, although it looks like your dress is missing that lovely train now.  I checked the hemline which had risen to calf-height after the release of the petal bomb. Its the sad cost of using the dresss flower smokescreen enchantment,
