PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: you. All of you. I didnt consider myself the best at giving speeches, but my words were enough to urge Franc into action. He shifted position and thrust up into me, his kisses capturing my groans of pleasure and chasing away my storm-cloud thoughts. He moved slowly at first as I adjusted to his size, waiting until I was digging my fingers into his hips, urging him on.  When at last Franc wrung an orgasm out of me, I could barely breathe as my mind shattered into a million pieces. He slowed down then, clearly not yet done himself yet, allowing me a few moments to recover. I sighed against his shoulder, feeling more in balance than I had in days. Months? Years? I would have tried having sex every day before this quest, had I such available, encouraging, and enthusiastic partners. I couldnt deny something was definitely off, newly off, with my magic. It seemed both more and less chaotic than before, but I did not know what had changed to make it so. I needed to figure it out, but now I had better things to focus on, like the demi-god rocking his substantial cock slowly in and out of me. When I opened my eyes, to my surprise, I saw Caden had slipped into the room. He stood silent, drinking in the sight of pleasure as only an incubus could. Franc glanced behind us, holding Cadens gaze for a moment before returning his attention to me. Caden seemed content to watch, but I wanted more of him. I gestured for him to come over and join us. He shrugged, his short, black, messy hair
