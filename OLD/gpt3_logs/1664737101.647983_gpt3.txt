PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: my rose dress lit up with ethereal shades of white, green, and blue. The thudding of the bass, so strong I felt my heart shudder with each beat, drowned the music out. The effect lulled me into motion, swaying with the rhythm and momentarily forgetting my cares.  I held two fingers over my navel and then spoke to my dress. "Dress, play You Light up my Eternity." The cords blared out, discordant with the club's steady beat. I spun in circles, watching my dress glow under the flashing lights. "Your dress has speakers and a playlist?" Jax asked. "I told you it's enchanted! It even does karaoke!" Jax asked me over the boom boom boom of the music. Do you want to grab a drink or dance for a while? Neither." I tapped the dress, and the song stopped. It was time to get to work. "I need the lay of the land. I take it youve been here before? Straight to business. I can respect that. Ive been here a couple of times. Allow me to show you around?  Jax offered me her elbow and directed me through the hopping dance hall and through a pair of large ornate doors into an unexpected but delightful garden. Unlike the wild atmosphere of the dance hall, this was a calm space full of manicured cedars, exquisitely carved fountains full of dolphins and cherubs, life-size anatomically correct marble satyrs, and conveniently spaced benches.  This is not the realm of debauchery and wild abandon Id expected from a demi-god of Dionysos, I said. Jax winked at me, leading us around the perimeter
