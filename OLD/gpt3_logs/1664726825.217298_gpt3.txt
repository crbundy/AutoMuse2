I couldnt even imagine trying to explain this situation to my grandmother. Not only werent they mages, there were five of them. Dara Lowe would have a hearty laugh, at least until she realized I wasnt kidding.  Yet the choice of whether or not to mate had been taken away from me with Franc by fate, and as I looked the five over, I could feel the tipping point as viscerally as the grains of sand whipping in through the portal.   Especially Emrys, Taneisha replied, drawing me out
