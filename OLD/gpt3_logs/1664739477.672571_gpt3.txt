PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: reduced to one-word sentences. Im. Coming. Her orgasm caused a cascade reaction, sending Franc over the edge, and feeling the force of his release, I came a moment later.    Full Disclosure Sera I was glowing all over, lips swollen from Cadens and Francs kisses and pussy still throbbing from what might have been the hottest sex ever. Or so far?  I chuckled to myself. If things kept going in this direction, I might not be able to walk in a couple of days. A tightness clamped down on my heart, as I realized the next few days might be all I had before returning to my regular life. Which was definitely, of course, what I still wanted. At least I thought so? Caden pulled away from Franc, abruptly going to stand under the water streaming from the shower head. In my gut I knew something was off, and a glance at Francs troubled expression confirmed my fears.  Franc gently kissed me on the forehead, and then pulled me away from the wall, holding me by my ass as I lowered my feet to the ground. He didnt let go until I steadied myself, both of our attentions focused on the incubus. Is everything okay, Caden? Franc asked.  The demon sped through his shower, taking his time before answering. A moment ago hed been lost to pleasure along with Franc and I, but now he was all business. As much as I wanted to revel in our post-sex high, supporting Caden and his quest took priority. Caden soaped himself up and then rinsed off under the hot water before he turned toward us. Its not.
