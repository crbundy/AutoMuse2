Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: retribution, but shes not someone who wronged you. Arent you violating your own rules? He had a point, but I didnt have to like it. Shes chosen to stay, I reminded him. Ray shook his head and then rose to his feet. Agreed, but that doesnt clear you. By your own accounts, you owe Sera. I shot to my feet, rattled by his words. I suppose you have a point. Its been good to talk, Tany, but its past time I get going. He leaned close and whispered into my ear. The woman I can love is one who can let go of retribution. One who can reimagine herself. One who can move past her childhood pain and move forward into the future unencumbered. The murmur of his words in my ear, feeling his strength pressed against my body, turned me to jelly. I love it when you mumbo jumbo transformation talk to me. He chuckled. Open me a portal, Tany, he whispered. To Chillax. I couldnt deny him or keep him away from his home one moment longer. Besides, I needed time to think about his request. I snapped my fingers, and a portal opened to the labyrinth at The Chillax Center. Come visit me when youve wrapped up this mess with your old academy friends. Theres a tantra class I think you should check out. I pulled myself up onto my tiptoes to plant a kiss on his broad, soft nose. Ill visit soon. Ray pulled me into a breath-stealing hug for a few blissful moments, and then he was gone through the portal, which blew out of existence after his passage. I could change. For a future
