Hes not wrong, Liam. Cant you see that Taneisha, or her maze, is distracting you from your legacy by keeping you apart from Sera? They had a point. Besides, the sooner I found my legacy, the sooner wed be back with Sera and Em. Maybe?  Dont you think if shes with Em that hed do whatever he can to protect her? Franc asked. Yeah.
