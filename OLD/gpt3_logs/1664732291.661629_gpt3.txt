Our queen will know what youve done, incubus. I will make sure of it. I tried to ignore the sinking feeling in my gut. This wasnt something I could take back. There would be consequences, but Id worry about those on another day. Now I was just glad to be alive. I nodded to the Anzu, and then turned and walked through the portal with my family of choice by my side.

Marcos ran to me and scooped me up into his arms, his embrace crushingly
