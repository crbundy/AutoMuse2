PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: strong, even for an incubus, but I was powerless to refuse the combination of Seras siren call and my longtime lover, Francs invitation. I walked into the shower and peeled off my clothes, sighing with relief as I freed my erection from the constriction of the leather pants. I left my chain necklace on, otherwise I would have drawn Liam and Marcos into the mix, and that wasnt what I had in mind for tonight. Id never liked the idea of coercing someone into my arms with my powers. Where was the fun of using an enchantment few could withstand? Amping up the enjoyment once they were interested? Most definitely.  I clenched my jaw, feeling my molars protest my grinding. I needed to keep some measure of distance between Sera and I. I had to. I would not be foolish like those mating-driven shifters, and I didnt believe demons had fated mates. Especially me, an incubus? Can you imagine? Stuck with one woman? One... anyone? Anything? Not gonna happen. In my experience, no one was that interesting for that long, and I had a ravenous hunger to keep up with. Perhaps I should have walked right out of the room, but I needed a taste. Just a taste, I repeated to myself, but my cock twitched with anticipation of so much more. I approached them, squaring myself up behind Franc, but then took a moment to drink him, well, both of them, in. I loved everything about Franc. He was my partner in crime, confidant, best friend, and he had the literal body of a Greek god, so I had to take a moment
