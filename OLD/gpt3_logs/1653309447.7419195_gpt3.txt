PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: The passage discusses the uselessness of art, how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography. It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The mind of a well-informed person is like a bric-a-brac shop, full of dust and monsters, the author says. They think that their friend has changed and become less attractive to them. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry Wotton that he does not want him to meet Dorian Gray, as he is the only person who gives his art whatever charm it possesses. Dorian Gray is sitting at a piano, turning the pages of a book of music. He tells his friend Basil that he wants to learn the piece, and Basil says it depends on how Dorian sits. Dorian says he is tired of sitting and does not want a life-sized portrait of himself. When he sees Lord Henry, he blushes and starts to get up. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he is one of Lady Agatha's favorites, and Dorian says he is in her black books at the moment. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he will make peace with Lady Agatha. Aunt Agatha makes a lot of noise when she plays the piano, and Dorian finds it annoying. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he is too charming to be philanthropic, and Basil asks Lord Henry to leave so he can finish his painting. Dorian Gray insists that Lord Henry Wotton stay and chat with him while he poses for a painting, over the protestations of the painter, Basil Hallward.
