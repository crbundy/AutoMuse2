Passage: worry fretted at the back of my mind. If she was still this energized, then we had a way to go to burn through the wild magic coursing through Seras veins. Emrys moved closer until he pressed up against Seras thigh. He ran a hand through her hair to tame her wild tresses. Magic crackled against his fingers, but he gave no sign of the electric fire bothering him. Are you feeling any relief, darling? Emrys asked, cupping her cheek. She leaned into his touch like the hopeful thirsty at an empty well. The smile Sera shone his way had a hungry edge to it, almost frenzied, and I knew we still had a long way to go to help her. It was then I realized how much she needed each of us. No wonder fate had matched her with all five of us. I crave you, Em, she replied, before running a hand across my chest, gripping at my flesh. All of you.     Maenad in the Sheets Emrys  When I scooped Sera up, pulling her from off Liam, he didnt object. The shifter looked unusually worn out from their encounter, so I didnt doubt hed welcome me stepping in. Sera settled into my lap, entwining sweaty limbs around my body, kissing my cheeks and then down my throat, nibbling as she went. If I had my way, Id carry her out of this club, take her to my loft downtown, and have my way with her for days on end. But there was no leaving, at least not until wed unraveled the faes knot.  Hmm, she purred against my skin. You always smell so good. She sighed. Cedar and sage. Like the desert itself.
