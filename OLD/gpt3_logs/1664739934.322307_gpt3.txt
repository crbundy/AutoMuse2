Passage: with alarm and took my face in her hands. Im right here, Em. Im fine. Were all fine. And were all going to get home. If only what Seras doppelgnger said was true, but Id been through all of this before. So many times. How long had I been in Taneishas special version of hell? There was no way for me to know. The hours and days had blended together. Had I even slept? I couldnt recall. Id lived and breathed this surreal landscape of disappointment for far too long. I wasnt even sure my memories of the time before were correct. Enough wallowing.  I tucked Seras hair behind her ear, loving the silky feel of it against my fingers. Loving the feel of her hands on me. These visions of Sera were the best dreams. If anything happens to you, I swear Ill never forgive myself. I hope one day you can forgive me. Her brow furrowed. Sera leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek. Im a big girl, Em. I knew helping you against a fae was a bad idea, yet I did it anyway.  Her fingers threaded through the hair at my nape, pulling me into a near-electric kiss that swept me away. I let myself fall into her embrace, pushing Sera back against the shelf, greedy for her heat. I knew this delusion might all fade away at any moment, but at this moment, I could almost believe Sera was real. When she bit my lower lip with her teeth, I sucked in a breath. She hadnt done that before. I debated pushing this encounter in a new direction. How much room to play would I have in this dream?
