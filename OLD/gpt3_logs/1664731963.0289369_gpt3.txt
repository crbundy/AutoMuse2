Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: didnt realize Emrys had arrived until I heard his words and the accusation in his tone. I opened my eyes, my mind still hazy from the bliss of multiple orgasms and the discharge of my magic. And what a way to do it!  Normally, I would have been too shy to even think of burning my magical overload off with sex. Id stuck to marathon gym sessions because of their simplicity and availability. But this forced proximity with the posse gave me an opportunity to explore new avenues. Best of all: we were only together for the time needed to complete the faes tasks. When all of this was over, wed go our separate ways with some delicious memories. No one had to be the wiser.  I felt bad Emrys had missed the action. But there was time for that later, right? Oh my gods, my brain had gone all sex-addled. But hell, I was having a hard time coming up with reasons that might be a bad thing. Emrys stood in the middle of the room, holding what looked like a red plastic bag in one hand. Im gone for an hour, and I come back to an orgy? he asked. Why arent you out looking for pixies? We did that, but when we couldnt find anything. Marcos and I came back here to wait for you guys to catch up with us, Liam explained. Doesnt seem like you waited very long, he spat out.  Caden and I arrived a few minutes ago ourselves, Franc added. Still plenty of time for us to join in for the crescendo. At least in part, Caden murmured, wiggling his brows at Franc. I thought back through
