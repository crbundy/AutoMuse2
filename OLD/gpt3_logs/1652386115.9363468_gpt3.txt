PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.  Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.  How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes? he asked. How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. Its as true as gospel, for I began as a ships carpenter.  Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.  Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?  I wont insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.  Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?  What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?  Well, but China?  The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily.
