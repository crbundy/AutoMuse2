With barely a glance to get my bearings in the room, I headed directly to the super-sized round bed in the middle of the space, illuminated only by the moon shining down through a series of skylights. A series of oak bedposts ringed the bed, each entwined with vines which grew straight up towards and across the ceiling, forming a canopy of greenery overhead. Translucent swaths of fabric hung between the bed posts covered with blooming roses, which filled the space with their heady essence. Jasmine vines grew over everything, their white blooms glowing in the moonlight and adding a touch of musk in the air. The room was also large enough to contain a few couches, small tables, and chairs placed around the outer wall which encircled this space. From those seats, one could either watch revelers within the cella or in the outer temple through the one-way mirrored wall. Franc did nothing halfway, especially not when it had to do with honoring his grandfather and namesake, Dionysos. Before we reached the bed, Seras lips were on mine, drawing almost all my available focus. I set her down on her feet, and then peeled off my jacket, hearing the leather hit the floor behind me. Sera pulled at my shirt, shredding the fabric and sending pink sparks flying as she ripped it open.
