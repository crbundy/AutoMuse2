But above the grey land and the drifting dust, you can see the blue and gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. Tom Buchanan's mistress lived in a small, yellow brick building on the edge of a waste land. One afternoon, Tom took his friend to meet her. The friend was not interested in meeting her, but Tom was insistent. The building contained three shops, one of which was for rent.
