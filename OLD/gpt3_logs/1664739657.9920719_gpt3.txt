Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: I couldnt quite name the reason. That, for once, I didnt have to be in control, was strangely seductive. Knowing Franc would be the one driving me over the edge quenched a thirst I didnt know I had. Okay, I nodded, and Franc tied the blindfold around my head, blocking out the moonlight and casting me into darkness. The next moment, Francs lips were on mine as he pulled me into a rough, hungry embrace. His tongue sought mine with desperate hunger, wiping my mind clear of my inner turmoil. He urged me to back up on the bed, joining me there. Pressed against him with his erection twitching against my stomach, my need to have him almost overwhelmed me. I could blame the sensuous magic of this place, but it didnt create these urges and wants in me. The magic of Velvet and the temple only lowered the threshold to my inhibitions, paving the way for me to take what I wanted without second-guessing myself.  Taking the lead, I kissed my way down Francs stomach to his cock, pulling his girth between my lips so I could taste the salty tang of him. The bed dipped behind me, and I gasped as a tongue zeroed in on my clit. Not knowing for sure which of my guys was toying with me short circuited something in my brain. I tried to focus on managing Franc, but I kept losing the pace to my pleasure. I jumped as someone slapped my ass, but it couldnt have been Franc, as his hands were fisting my hair.  Franc groaned. I think our mage needs some help with her focus. Let me try
