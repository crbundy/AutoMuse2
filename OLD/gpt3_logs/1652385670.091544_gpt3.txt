Passage: took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you think youre changed, do you?

Alice folded her hands, and began:  You are old, Father William, the young man said,     And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head     Do you think, at your age, it is right?  In my youth, Father William replied to his son,     I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that Im perfectly sure I have none,     Why, I do it again and again.  You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before,     And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door     Pray, what is the reason of that?  In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,     I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box     Allow me to sell you a couple?  You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak     For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak     Pray, how did you manage to do it?  In my youth, said his father, I took to the law,     And argued each case
