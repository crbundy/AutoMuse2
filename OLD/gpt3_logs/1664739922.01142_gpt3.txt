Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: Whats going on inside that head of yours? she whispered into my ear. I chuckled. Im just reminiscing over our prior liaisons and curious where this one will take us. Sounds like this scene has been a recurring theme? I was a little taken aback at her question, because it seemed out of character for the dream, but I definitely liked where this dream was headed. Most definitely. Weve tried so many things. So many variations on a theme. Im curious what will manifest this time. Sera pulled back, a wicked look in her eyes under an arched brow. Hmm. Is there anything Ive been unwilling to do in these dreams of yours? Shed always been direct, but this Sera was more flirty than I remembered, and I loved it. I opened my mouth to answer, but hesitated, suddenly anxious to disclose to this version of Sera what Id been up to with all the prior versions of her.  Before Id decided, Franc strode right through the far wall of the pantry and rushed up to us. This gave me pause. It was unusual for elements of these visions to disobey the laws of physics, but perhaps this was a new twist in Taneishas ruse? There you are, Franc said, seemingly oblivious to the obvious intimacy of the moment. Somethings coming. He looked back and forth between us, as if this announcement should have some meaning. Something...like what? What did you see? Sera asked, her lips pinker and plumper from our kisses, but her focus was now entirely on the new potential threat. Damn Francs
