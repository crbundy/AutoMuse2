PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: logic. I looked him over, seeing the incubus with fresh eyes. This wasnt his style, but I approved. Perhaps the reality of risking his legacy had inspired him to turn over a new leaf? Agreed, I said. I held Liams gaze, raising a brow. Liam relented, but only a smidge. Fine. I also agree, he said, but I could tell this conversation wasnt over. Caden let go of us, and we both took a step back. I turned to Sera, strode over to her, and hooked my index finger under her chin. She stood defiantly, her arms crossed in front of her. Sera stared up at me. The depths of her brown eyes, the fire in her heart, and the curve of her full lips stirred something within me.  For a moment, I lost myself, imagining what it would be like to have her compliant under my touch. My gifts, when unleashed, could turn the meek ferocious, and the powerful submissive. Was Sera the type of woman who, when under my thrall, would raze the countryside? Or was she the type whod purr like a kitten? I wanted to find out. But not now. Now, I needed to set expectations with our wee mage. Do you promise you wont withhold anything from us again? Promise to share anything that impacts our safety? She held up her left hand with the palm towards me, the middle three fingers straight, and the thumb crossed over her pinky. I solemnly swear I will disclose all pertinent knowledge to the posse. I frowned, but then nodded my acceptance. I stepped away, breaking contact with Sera, feeling the loss of her touch
