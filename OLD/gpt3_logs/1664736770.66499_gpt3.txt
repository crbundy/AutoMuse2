Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: panther urged me on, and a moment later I had Sera pinned up against a shelf, my mouth on hers as I explored her glorious curves with my hands. Her scent drove me wild, reminding me of honeysuckle blossoms on a hot, sunny afternoon. I ravished her neck with a line of kisses, nibbling as I went, spurred on by her gasps and moans. Seras fingers dug into my hips, gripping me against her. I want you, she whispered, and I looked up into her eyes, seeing the desire within. Both of you. Sera looked up over my shoulder at Liam, biting her lip. Also, this shelf isnt working for me. Give me a moment, Liam replied. If both of us are what you want, thats what youll get, I replied, my voice low. I heard Liam moving things around behind us in the shed as I lingered, tracing the outline of a nipple through Seras t-shirt. She arched against me, grinding her hips against my cock, and I let out a groan. It seems like this sort of works for you. Seras wicked little smile was all I needed, at least until she wrapped her arms around my neck, kissing me again with abandon, further fueling the fire between us. I pulled her away from the shelf, wrapped my arms around her, and then lifted her up. She wrapped her legs around my hips, and I carried her over to the bench Liam had freed up along the wall. Hed thrown our jackets down, covering the wooden surface. Liam came up behind Sera, sandwiching her between our bodies. All you had to do was ask, little mage, Liam growled out
