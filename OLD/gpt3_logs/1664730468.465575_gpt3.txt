Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: society without overwhelming those around me, but my demonic urges to seduce and ravish others never go away. Cooking is just another form of seduction, no? Ive found few ever refuse a good meal or decadent dessert. Was it getting warmer in here? I couldnt help letting my gaze wander all over him, but this time I wasnt focusing on the smears of chocolate. He wasnt as large-framed and muscular as the shifters, nor as tall as Franc, but he was all lean athletic muscle. The apron he wore left little to the imagination, especially the bulge of his swollen erection. My cheeks heated as I met Cadens gaze, realizing he must notice me staring at him. Not that he seemed self-conscious in the least.  Yeah, that makes sense. Is there a spoon I can use? I stuttered. Caden held up the spoon in his hand. This one? When I reached for it, he moved it out of my grasp. Do you want more? A tingle spread from my toes upward. I wanted him to hand over the damned spoon, but my stomach was doing flip-flops over his request. By the glint in his very amused gaze, I guessed he wouldnt back down easily. I let out a breathy whisper. Sure. Triumphant, Caden moved in with his spoon, scooping up a bite while I held the bowl. He spoon fed me a bite of the peach ice cream, which was just as amazing as the first one, but somehow so much hotter. I couldnt remember a time when anyone had fed me like this. Caden seemed to know the perfect angle of the spoon, the perfect quantity to have in each
