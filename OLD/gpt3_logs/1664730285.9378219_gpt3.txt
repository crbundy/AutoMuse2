Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: some steam before we get up? I tried to roll over and face him, but Marcos shifted his weight, pinning my legs in place with his hips while he continued to tease my nipple between his fingers. Heat bloomed between my legs, and I writhed against Marcos, craving more skin on skin contact. What had started off as a flirtation had quickly transformed into a demand. He tugged at the hem of my shirt, and I pulled it off over my head. Marcos rewarded me with a line of kisses down my neck, nuzzling as he went. Is that all this is? Blowing off steam?  Was it just about the stress, or something more? I searched my heart, then my gut, and realized I didnt want to think too hard about it. Its complicated how I feel about you and the posse. Cant it be fun, and maybe something more too?  Saying those words, the possibility of something more hit me right in the gut. I enjoyed being around them and loved the sex and developing friendships. But when I thought about more, I had to think of what might happen after the quest for the posses stolen legacies. What might work now, in this faery-created bubble, didnt translate well to the normal world. Theres no maybe for me, Sera, he said, the timbre of his voice low and rumbling against the skin of my shoulder. He pulled away, hooking his thumbs around the waistband of my sweatpants. He bit the skin of my hip, gently but in a proprietary way. Is this what you want? he asked, tugging at my pants. Yesss, I said, hissing the word.
