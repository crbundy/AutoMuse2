Passage: his fingers lightly over my pussy, cupping it possessively. Im calling it my Utterly Fuckable Peach, he said, practically growling the words into my ear as he slid his fingers into my folds. I ground against his hand, his touch like a live wire of pleasure against my skin. I love how wet you are for me. I sighed in relief, needing more of his touch. I encircled his cock in my hand and gasped. Under his firm flesh, I felt a series of hard bumps not far under the skin. What are these?  He grinned. Theyre implants. When I cocked my head to the side, he explained further. Tiny ball bearings. Distracted by my curiosity, I took a better look. Thats, uh, kinky, and unusual. Did it hurt? He shrugged it off. Sure, but not for long. Theyre fun. Would you like to weigh in? he asked, strumming his fingertips along my clit.  Ill cast my vote for posterity, I said, biting my lip. Id heard demons sexual appetites were more extreme than other species, and I wondered what else I didnt know. Condom? He groaned under my touch as I stroked him, absently dragging his cheek up along my neck. And no, I dont have any condoms. However, my charmed necklace doesnt just dampen my incubus effect. It also acts as birth control. Then what are you waiting for? I whispered, grinding my hips against his hand. I trust you. He caught my chin with his free hand and turned me to look into his eyes. Youre sure about that? Yes, I said, and he frowned. Okay, I definitely trust
