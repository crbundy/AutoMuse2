Passage: in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.  I wish I hadnt cried so much! said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.  Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, theres no harm in trying. So she began: O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse! (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brothers Latin Grammar, A mouseof a mouseto a mousea mouseO mouse!) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.  Perhaps it doesnt understand English,
