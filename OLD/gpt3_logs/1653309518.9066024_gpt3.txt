Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The passage describes a scene in which a rider delivers a message to a guard, who then reads it aloud. The message is simply "Recalled to Life," but the guard is surprised by it. The rider then leaves, and the other passengers pretend to be asleep. The guard on the coach is worried about the message he heard and decides to investigate. Jerry, left alone, dismounts to take a break and check on his horse. The passage reflects on the idea that every person is a mystery to everyone else, and that this is something that can be both wonderful and terrible. It also notes that sometimes things are hidden from us that we can never know about. The rider on horseback is a mystery to the other passengers in the coach, just as they are mysteries to him. He has eyes that seem to be hiding something, and he is very secretive. He stops at ale-houses along the way to drink, but he is careful to keep his muffler over his face. The passage describes a messenger riding to deliver a message, and the shadows of the night taking shapes to him and the horse he is riding.
