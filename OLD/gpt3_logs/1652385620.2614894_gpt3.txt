Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: I wont indeed! said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. Are youare you fondofof dogs? The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itll fetch things when you throw them, and itll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of thingsI cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says its so useful, its worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats andoh dear! cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, Im afraid Ive offended it again! For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.  So she called softly after it, Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we wont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont like them! When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then Ill tell you my history, and youll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.     CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race
