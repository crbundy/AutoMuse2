PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: hands. He was hovering around me like hed done when Em had first asked for my help, playing out a scene I remembered all too well. How could I not? he murmured. Ems gaze raked up my body, lingering on my curves, my neck, and my lips.  Okay, so Ems memory seemed intact, but his usual cocky confidence now had a feral edge to it. Like he was barely holding onto his control. My breathing quickened, and I sucked in my lower lip, rolling it between my teeth. Perhaps I shouldnt find this version of him even more appealing, but I had to admit that I was fighting a losing battle. Not just with Emrys.  Ive come back here again and again, Sera, he whispered, the heat of his body sending a shiver through my own. Im not sure what else I can say. Did Em mean hed revisited this memory while in Taneishas sensory deprivation tank? Heat blossomed across my cheeks. Remind me? I asked, curiosity peaked.    We Arent in Kansas Anymore Emrys Like I could deny Seras plea, spoken from those lush heart-shaped lips as her inviting breasts heaved mere inches away from me? Every time she asked, I gave in. Gave her whatever she asked for. Sometimes she told me to leave, so Id leave. Sometimes she bantered with me about whether shed help me and wed argue back and forth for what felt like hours. This place, and this scenario, wasnt quite up to Taneishas prior efforts, but its not like calling her out would improve my situation, so I just rolled with it. Who cared if the edges of this
