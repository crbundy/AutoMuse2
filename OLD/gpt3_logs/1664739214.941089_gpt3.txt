PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: bulky as some nightclub bouncers, but I knew he could handle himself in a fight. Liam faced away from me and pulled his shirt off over his head, his broad shoulders covered with freckled, tanned skin covered with a fine sheen of dark ginger hair. Built like a brick house and with those calloused hands, I figured he worked hard every day.  Oh, my. Things were warming up in here, and it wasnt the humidity. If I didnt know any better, Id think they were putting on a show for me.  Are you just going to stand there and watch us strip down? Marcos asked, hesitating while unbuckling his belt. I knew the panther shifter was slow to warm to people. Was he also shy?  I opened my mouth to answer, but Liam beat me to the punch. Shes a lady, Marcos. Marcos chuckled, but then looked me over. Yeah, Seras a lady, all right. So? So... a lady does as she damn well pleases. Liam glanced at me over his shoulder, and I knew he was egging me on and giving me permission to keep watching them. He unzipped his jeans and then slid them and his underwear off at the same time. What a flirt! I could use a hand fan right about now, I muttered, and they both smiled. I didnt expect you two to strip before shifting. Our options are to take them off or shred them, and Im not ruining the only clothes I have with me, Marcos replied. He turned away before dropping his pants and stepping out of them, moving as gracefully as his panther. I mean I knew that. More in theory than face to face,
