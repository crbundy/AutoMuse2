Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: more than I engage for, I assure you.        But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it       would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are       determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you       know, they visit no newcomers.

I have a high respect for your nerves.       They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with       consideration these twenty years at least.        Ah, you do not know what I suffer.        But
