PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: wrapped her hands around the back of my neck, forcefully pulling me down into a desperate kiss. Who was I to complain? Sera conquered my lips with the intensity of an invasion, as if she could reassure herself of my presence through contact alone. When she slowed, it was only to nip at my lower lip. Ive been so worried about you, she breathed out, placing another kiss on my cheek before she dropped back. Worried about me? Her words warmed my heart as her kisses had stirred my cock. And I, you. Your sleep was so dysregulated. You havent awoken since the fae knocked you out. Sera reached up and ran her hands through her hair and then felt her clothes. Was it all a dream? she whispered to herself, a frown etched across her brow. How long have you been awake? she asked me. Which time? I replied, to which she frowned. When Taneisha fogged you all unconscious, I ran to you. Its been some time since then, but I have no way of knowing how long. Ive slept twice myself. Sera paled and then pushed herself up into a sitting position. I moved closer, wary of her unsteady movements. Thats a lot of time lost to find Liams legacy. Where are the others? She looked around us, perhaps expecting them to be nearby. Im not sure. Weve been locked in here since you passed out. Id suspect the others are facing similar circumstances. Have you looked for secret passages yet? I have, multiple times, but I found nothing. Youre welcome to look, but these walls have held us in
