PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: me as if she couldnt help but deepen the contact between us. Assuming I let you, she murmured. Oh, my dear, you wont just let us, I taunted. She looked up at me, her lower lip caught between her teeth. Youll beg us.    The Temple of Dionysos Marcos The sultry, ambient music of the temple hit me before we even crossed under the archway. Vines clung to the decorative stonework of the arch, with the words, The art of living well and the art of dying well are one, carved into the gray granite surface. Id read that phrase over and over, but never had it hit me in the gut like it did today after days and days of Taneisha putting us all at risk. Placing my mate, our mate, at risk.  I tensed, grinding my teeth, as I crossed over the threshold, the magic in this space rolling over my skin like an old friends embrace. For anyone else, the energy here would loosen their inhibitions and free their mind, but Id long since acclimated to my near daily exposure to it. We walked into the entryway, the sounds of devotees emanating from the other side of the curtain which separated the temple space proper from passers-by. Sera wobbled on her feet, clinging to Francs arm for support. Woah, what was that? Each space in the club has a unique feel, Franc replied, running his fingers down Seras arm. The magic within the temple has a way of breaking down boundaries, freeing our more animalistic natures. Liam leaned in close. You look uncomfortable, Liam whispered, a sly smile
