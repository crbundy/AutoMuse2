PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: claim them? Just to be nice? I got it. Franc didnt want me hurting his friends or himself. I shook my head. I dont want to disappoint them or hurt any of you, but Im really not serious about mating. Its a lot of commitment. Plus, my family wouldnt accept one, much less two mates. He frowned, his gaze taking on a steely glint. In moments like these, Seraphina, Id like nothing more than to turn you over my knee and turn that pretty backside of yours a lovely shade of rose. I gasped, the image all too clear in my mind. I expected to feel indignant, but to my surprise, a flash of heat rolled over me. Then he continued on as if his statement hadnt just thrown me for a tailspin. So, tell me. Whats your opinion of your mating marks? It took me a moment to gather my thoughts when all I could think of was his hand on my ass. When Franc arched his brow, I suddenly found the words. Ive said it before and I havent changed my mind. Its got to be more fae magic. If Taneisha can construct these worlds within worlds, then putting some marks on my back to mess with all of our minds would be childs play. Then youve turned both Liam and Marcos down? Unequivocally? So they dont hold out hope? I dont want to I started, but I couldnt say the next words out loud. Lose them. I didnt want to lose them. The idea of parting ways with the shifters made my stomach ache, and the prospect of never seeing Caden, Emrys, or Franc again sent a wave of nausea rolling over me. Oh
