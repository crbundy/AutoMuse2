PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: the trail below. Although Id grown up in New Orleans, my grandmother had brought me here to the Netherworld, the land of our people, on a handful of occasions. I wasnt sure last night, but now, I was certain. By the quality of the light, I knew we were in the pre-dawn hours. Enough for the time being. You and Marcos should get a couple of hours in before we head out. Liam stood up, stretching. Dont mind if I do. I tried not to imagine Sera wrapped around Liam and failed. Still, Id pay good money for that show anytime. You see anything? We heard ghouls in the distance. A couple approached the mage fire at the river, but then wandered off. One we saw nosing around at the ghoul corpse remnants on the road. None of them ventured further up this way, Marcos replied. Franc lumbered out from the back, walking stiffly from the rough sleeping. He cracked his neck, letting out a sigh of relief. That good? Marcos asked him.  Franc flashed us his demure dont you wish you were me, smile. Cave sleeping has its charm. I think we all knew he meant Seras company. At least, I got the joke, but I wasnt laughing. Marcos knocked knuckles with Franc and then headed towards the back of the cave. Towards Sera. I rarely felt jealous. Demons werent wired for it, particularly not incubi. The more in the party, the more I fed off the raw lust. Yet now I experienced a momentary pang of well, something. We found some snack bars and canteens in the packs, Liam said. Nothing much
