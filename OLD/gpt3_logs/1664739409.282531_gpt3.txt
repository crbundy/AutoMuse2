Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: Perhaps this wasnt the best idea? But it looked okay, so, yay? I reached for a confidence I didnt feel. Nicely done, Marcos said, once again by my side. And you doubted your powers. Im not entirely sure itll hold, I replied. Or behave. Im sure it will give them pause, Marcos replied. Cool trick, Franc called from up the trail. We should still get out of here. Now! I wasnt arguing. I spun and headed up the trail, sprinting after Franc and Caden, Marcos at my side. Just as we reached Caden and Franc, angry shrieks filled the night behind me. I couldnt help it; I stopped and turned to watch. Would my wall of fire hold? I saw three creatures on the other side of the river, their glowing silver eyes tinged pink through the wall of fire. They might have once been human, but their thin, naked bodies looked like husks that had been left out to dry under the desert sun. Even from this distance, I could make out their exaggerated sharp teeth and long claws. The three ghouls were soon joined by two more. Just how many were there? They snapped their jaws and moved close to the river, caution overriding their need to pursue us, at least for now. How long will it hold? Caden asked.  Great question. If only I knew. It depends. Franc swore under his breath. This is not the time for the stereotypical cagey mage attitude. Cool it, Marcos replied, shutting Franc down. Lets get to the cave. I headed up the trail, my attention split between my footing and the wall
