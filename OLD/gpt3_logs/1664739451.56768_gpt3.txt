PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: his brow knit with worry. Especially Marcos. Hes a beast in any form. Im going to check the bags for weapons, Franc said, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. Be careful this close to the edge. Franc moved to help Caden search through the packs, and I groaned in frustration. Then I caught sight of the ghouls coming around the second switchback, and my heart skipped a beat. Liam and Marcos had the high ground, but would that be enough? As if in answer to my question, one of the remaining ghouls exploded, sending a burst of mage fire out in all directions. The remaining ghoul cowered from the blast, but then rallied, screeching into the night. Thats some luck, Caden said, taking a couple of steps closer to the edge, no doubt looking for a view of the action after that explosion. He looked even more anxious than I felt. Where did Marcos go? I dunno, he was right next to Liam. I leaned forward, scanning the area. I cant make out his form in the dark. Francs hand came around my waist, pulling me back a step from the edge. Careful, sweet, mind the edge. He pressed a knife into my hand but kept me close. Take this.  The blades only six inches long. What use would it be against that? I asked, motioning to the flaming ghoul advancing on Liams hunched, growling form. Its better than nothing, Franc whispered against my ear. Keep quiet. We dont want to draw attention to our location. I gave over and slumped against him, gripping the knife firmly.
