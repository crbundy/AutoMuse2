I curled up next to him, spooning up against his warmth as he wrapped one of those big, muscular arms around me.  I might be in the Netherworld, but somehow surrounded by Marcos and the others, Id never felt safer. I drifted off to a deep, dreamless sleep, only to awaken a few hours later. My brain was in overdrive, knowing Id have to get up soon and didnt want to oversleep. I snuggled up against Marcos, the heat of his body an invitation I didnt want to deny. When he pulled me tight against him, his erection pressed against my ass, all worries about trudging uphill in the dark and sneaking up on a winged monster fled my mind. Id already tasted that beautiful cock of his once, and now I wanted more. I ground my hips back against him, deliberately teasing for a reaction. Are you awake? I asked, my voice a whisper.
