PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: The passage describes the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love.
