Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: entirely the wrong way?  Looks like were getting a steady stream of revelers coming back in. They arent getting close yet, Marcos said. No pressure.

For a moment nothing happened, but then the structure gave way and separated from the column all at once, sending the stone column topping to the floor. When it hit, the stone shattered, flying in all directions. I held the cage as it undulated between my hands, as if might escape me, but I held on.  Nice trick, what now? Liam asked.  Im not sure, I said. As I looked over the cage for new weaknesses, I noticed its movements were slowing. In less than a minute, the vines were withering and browning. Wait, I think were good after all. The vines are dying. You did it! Emrys declared.  Everyone turned to watch as the vines turned to husks and fell apart under my hands. Soon all I held was the mask, and I clutched it to my chest in relief.  Taneisha appeared, slowly
