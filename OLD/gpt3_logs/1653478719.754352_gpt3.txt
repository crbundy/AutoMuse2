Story so far: The city is on edge due to a string of murders. The killings seem to be random with no motive or pattern. The latest victim was stabbed to death, which is different from the previous victims who were all shot in the head. The detectives are doing their best to catch the killer before he strikes again.The wife of a victim of a shooting recounts the incident to a detective. She says that they were walking home from getting food when they heard a gunshot and her husband fell to the ground. The shooter was a man who then ran away.The wife of the victim tells the detective that her husband was a good man and she does not know of anyone who would want to hurt him. The detective and his partner agree that she is telling the truth but she is still a suspect because she could have easily hidden the gun.The detective and his partner visit Mrs. Turner in her apartment to ask her about her husband. Mrs. Turner offers them coffee, and the detective looks around the room. He asks Mrs. Turner how she's been doing since the incident.

Last chunk: You think somebody else did it?" asked the partner.

"I think so," said the detective.

The detective and his partner walked down the street together.

"I'm going to check the place out," said the detective.

"Who do you think did it?" asked the partner.

"I don't know," said the detective. "But I'm going to find out."

The detective walked into a nearby apartment building. He walked up to the second floor and knocked on a door. After a moment, the door opened.

"Hello, Mrs. Turner," said the detective. "I'm here about your husband."

"Come in, Mr. Holmes," said Mrs. Turner.

The detective and his partner walked into the apartment. Mrs. Turner was a middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. She led them into the living room and offered them a seat.

"Would you like some coffee?" she asked.

"That would be wonderful, thank you," said the detective.

"How do you take it?" asked Mrs. Turner.

"Black, please," said the detective.

Mrs. Turner went into the kitchen to make the coffee. The detective looked around the room. It was a nice apartment, with a large bay window and hardwood floors.

"How have you been doing since the incident, Mrs. Turner?"

"I've been doing all right," said Mrs. Turner. "I just have trouble sleeping at night."

"That's to be expected," said the detective. "Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?"

"Of course not," said Mrs. Turner. "I'll be right back with the coffee."

Mrs. Turner walked into the kitchen and poured the coffee into three mugs. She took a tray and carried the three mugs into the living room. She set the mugs down on the coffee table and took a seat on the couch.

"I'm sorry I couldn't get sugar or cream," she said.

"That's quite all right," said the detective. "I take it black, just like this."

"It's very nice," said the partner, taking a sip of his coffee.

"I'll go first," said the detective. "I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Turner. Your husband was a good man, and he will be missed."

"Thank you, Mr. Holmes," said Mrs. Turner. "I appreciate that."

"I understand that you were walking down the sidewalk with your husband when the incident occurred," said the detective. "Is that correct?"

"That's right," said Mrs. Turner. "We were walking home from the grocery store."

"And did you
