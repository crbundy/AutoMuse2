PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: her. Its not like she was just some human woman in Francs club looking for a good time. Seraphina was a mage of the Lowe family, renowned for their power. In this moment, despite sleeping rough and no doubt still sleep deprived, she held herself with the grace of someone used to wielding authority.  Her self-assuredness was such a turn on. What can you tell us about this place? Despite the intensity of her gaze, a nagging thought tugged at my thoughts. Why had Seras mage fire been so wild last night? If I took her offhand comment as honesty, she hadnt entirely known how the mage fire would behave. How could a mage not know how their magic would perform? Was that typical mage guile, sarcasm, or was there more going on here? Caden? she asked, bringing my thoughts back to her question. Do you know where we are and who were up against? Were in the Netherworld. I think, I explained. I cant know for sure, but with the ghouls and the quality of the light, all read as the demon dimension to me. I recognize a few landmarks on the map. Plus, it just... smells like I remember. Then youve been here before? If its indeed the Netherworld, then yeah. Granny Lily brings me here every few years. Its a forced pilgrimage to reconnect with my roots or some such bullshit. Granny? Okay, lets go with that, Sera said. Taneisha said someone stole your legacy from her and that they live at the top of a tall mountain. She dropped us here, so its safe to assume this is this
