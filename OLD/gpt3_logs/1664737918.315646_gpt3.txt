PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: exactly received a detailed brief to strategize from. It wasnt the first time Id run a campaign with less than thirty minutes notice. This wasnt a game, yet strategy was strategy. It would have to be good enough. Thats fine, Sera, but were a little beyond the lets shake hands and move on stage now.  I held up my hands. I dont see why we have to be? Im sure the boys, I mean the men, can provide reparations much more suited to your needs than whatever trinkets you took from them. Im listening to you fairly because I always liked you, Sera. You make a fair argument. Understand, their trinkets hold no value for me. I have no need of earthly wealth. Years ago, I vowed these boys would pay when the time was right. The vow cannot be undone, and their time is now. I reject your offer. My shoulders slumped. I understand. Thanks for hearing me out. I turned to Emrys. Sorry, I tried. He nodded, a grave expression on his face. Can you use that door to send me back home? I asked Taneisha. She crossed her arms, lips pouting in disappointment. I guess youre not the clever one after all, even though you finished at the top of our class. Did you not pay attention in fae portals 101? A nagging anxiety crawled over my skin. There was no such class, but the fae loved to speak in metaphor. I couldnt help it. My gaze flicked to Caden, who was running a hand through his chin-length black hair. Then he looked up at me, his raised brows seeming to ask, Well, did you?
