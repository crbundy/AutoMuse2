Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: more okay. Youre amazing Sera, I answered.  Sera smiled that sultry smile of hers, and then her lips were back, sliding down my shaft. I almost forgot what Id seen under her blissful attention. What do you think of the markings? Liam asked me telepathically. His hands gripped Seras hips, and I felt every thrust of his as I pumped into her mouth.  I was right at the edge, but his question made me focus. I see a wolfs moon. A panthers paw print. Something like an ankh? A grape leaf. And some sort of sigil? The moon and paw are classic mate markings. His gaze met mine. Shes our mate. My hold on the conversation was failing, distracted by the orgasm Sera was eager to pull out of me. But not just ours. There are three other marks. A moment hung in the air, and I knew we were both thinking the same thing. There were five marks. Five in our Supernova of Hotness posse.  I growled, my panther eager to claim Sera as my own. My willingness to share with Liam was one thing. The entire posse? No way, I said. Liam and I had dated women together before, so that wasnt entirely new territory. Shes ours. But Caden? Never. Franc? Maybe. Emrys? Nowadays he grated on my nerves after a single evening. This is very unusual. Ive never heard of non-shifters having mate markings. It must be an effect of the fae magic. Liam rocked Sera forward, driving deep into her and forcing my cock deep into her throat. I couldnt last any longer, crying out as I shot into her throat.
