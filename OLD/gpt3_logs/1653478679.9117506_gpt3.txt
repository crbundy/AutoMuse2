Story so far: The city is on edge due to a string of murders. The killings seem to be random with no motive or pattern. The latest victim was stabbed to death, which is different from the previous victims who were all shot in the head. The detectives are doing their best to catch the killer before he strikes again.

Last chunk: The city was tense.

It had been for weeks, ever since the string of murders began.

At first, it was just a few deaths, and the police thought that it was just some sort of gang war or something of the like.

But then, the killings got more frequent, and more people died.

There seemed to be no motive, no pattern to the crimes.

The people of the city were on edge, waiting for the killer to strike again.

"Please tell me that this is the last one," said one of the policemen.

"I hope so," said another.

They were huddled around the newest victim, kneeling on the ground and scribbling in their notebooks.

A few feet away, another detective was inspecting the body.

"What did you find?" one of the policemen asked.

The detective shrugged.

"Not much, really. This one's different. The others were all killed the same way. A single gunshot to the head. This one, though. He was stabbed to death."

The other policemen looked at each other.

"I'm very sorry for your loss," he said.

"He was such a good man," sobbed the wife. "Such a good man."

"I know this is hard, ma'am," said the detective, "but I need to ask you a few questions. Can you tell me what happened?"

"We were walking home from the restaurant," she said. "We'd just gotten our food, and we were walking back to our apartment. We'd just gotten to the alley when we heard a gunshot. I turned around to see what it was and I saw him falling to the ground. There was a man standing over him, holding a gun. I started screaming, and the man ran away."

"Did you get a good look at him?" asked the detective.

The wife shook her head.

"I didn't get a good look at his face," she said. "But I'll never forget that gun."

"What was it?" asked the detective.

"It was a
