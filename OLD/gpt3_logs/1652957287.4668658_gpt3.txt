Mrs. Wilson is a woman who is very proud of her husband's photographic work. She has recently changed her outfit to a cream-coloured dress and her personality has changed as well. She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it. Mrs. McKee is being pursued by Mr. McKee. The passage describes a conversation between two women, one of whom is married to a man named George B. Wilson. The first woman says that she is scared of her neighbor, who is a wealthy man named Gatsbys. The second woman says that she does not understand why people stay married to someone if they cannot stand them. Catherine tells Daisy that she should divorce Wilson and marry her instead, because Daisy's wife is a Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce. Daisy is shocked by the lie, but Catherine continues, saying that they would have to go West to live for a while until the scandal blows over. Mrs. McKee interrupts to tell her own story of almost marrying a man beneath her.
