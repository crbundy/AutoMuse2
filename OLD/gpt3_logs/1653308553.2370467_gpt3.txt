When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didnt know you had any one with you.

I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to have played a duet togetherthree duets, I believe. I dont know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.  Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you. And I dont think it really matters about your not
