Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: mind? Sera subvocalized a growl in reply, causing blood to flood even faster to my already growing erection. As I drew near, she rose onto her knees, the brilliant moonlight filtering in from the skylights above, painting her features with stark angles. Seras hands skimmed the hard planes of my chest. Then she wrapped her arms around me, pulling me close. I couldnt help myself. Hungry to taste her, I brought her lips up to mine, thrusting my tongue deep into the heat of her mouth. My wolfs urge to claim Sera had become the ever-present backbeat to all of my thoughts, but in this moment my beast relented, at peace under the comfort of her touch. I want you, she growled, her eyes lit with inner fire. If I hadnt known better, Id have thought she was a shifter too. Then take me, I baited her. Sera shifted her weight on the bed, pushing me backwards. I let myself fall, and she pounced upon me, straddling my hips and pushing me inside her in one smooth motion. I gasped out, the pleasure of being suddenly sheathed deep within her silken warmth almost too much for me to handle. I took hold of her thighs, pinning her in place while I worked to rein myself in.  By the wicked smile on her face, Sera knew she had me right on the edge. She planted a firm hand on my chest, and I grabbed it by the wrist, my wolf begging me to take control. To roll her underneath me. To take charge and show her everything I had to give. To claim her as mine. But that wasnt what Sera needed from me
