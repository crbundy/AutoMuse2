PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: me.  And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?  Yes.  Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.  This aroused the strangers attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.  Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.  And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.  Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear
