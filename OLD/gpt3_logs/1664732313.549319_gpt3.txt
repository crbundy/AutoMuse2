PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: covers back and laid down on the bed. A mottled pattern of red and black bruising covered his shin and calf, no doubt from the wraiths in the river earlier. That looks like it hurts, I said. Now I feel even worse about knocking you off that raft. Dont trouble yourself, Sera. It looks worse than it feels, he replied. Now come over here and let me warm you up.  I curled up next to him, spooning up against his warmth as he wrapped one of those big, muscular arms around me.  I might be in the Netherworld, but somehow surrounded by Marcos and the others, Id never felt safer. I drifted off to a deep, dreamless sleep, only to awaken a few hours later. My brain was in overdrive, knowing Id have to get up soon and didnt want to oversleep. I snuggled up against Marcos, the heat of his body an invitation I didnt want to deny. When he pulled me tight against him, his erection pressed against my ass, all worries about trudging uphill in the dark and sneaking up on a winged monster fled my mind. Id already tasted that beautiful cock of his once, and now I wanted more. I ground my hips back against him, deliberately teasing for a reaction. Are you awake? I asked, my voice a whisper. The deep-throated sound Marcos made deep in this throat was almost a purr. You can bet I am now. His hand slipped under my shirt, cupping my breast in his hand, before he found and rolled my nipple between his fingers. I let out a low groan, loving the attention. What do you say we blow off
