Yet, something unsettled snaked through the back of my mind. I narrowed my gaze, trying to remember where I was. It was a curious, expansive space full of black leather furniture and odd wooden devices with chains and cuffs at the ready. Vines had taken over latticework panels, serving as living partitions between spaces. Sections of the concrete floor heaved upward as life invaded and order yielded to nature. In another area, the concrete floor had dropped away, giving ground to a vast goldfish-filled pool covering the far end of the room. Even my staff had caught life, sprouting oak leaves along the top section as if it, too, would fight back against death itself. Why had I come here? Hadnt I been doing
