Outline: In Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is publicly humiliated and forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her dress to mark her as an adulteress. Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in town under an assumed name and begins to plot revenge against the man he believes to be Hester's lover. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is born out of wedlock and Hester is forced to raise her alone. Eventually, the townspeople begin to see Hester as a symbol of strength and resilience, and her husband is revealed to be the true sinner. Hester is finally able to move on with her life and finds happiness with a new husband.

This passage describes the arrival of ships at Salem's port, and the bustle that ensues. The port is not as busy as it used to be, but on days when several ships arrive at once, there is a lot of activity. The people who come to the port include the shipmasters and the ship owners. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs.

The author has a sentimental attachment to their hometown because their family has been living there for centuries and they can't help but feel connected to the place.

And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be content to call affection. The sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck into the soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and forest-bordered settlement, which has since become a city. And here his descendants have been born and died, and have mingled their earthy substance with the soil; until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it desirable to know.  But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the
