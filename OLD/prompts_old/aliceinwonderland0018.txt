Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has adventures. Along the way, she wonders about her identity and whether she has been changed into someone else. Ultimately, she decides that she would rather stay in the world she is in than go back to the real world. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying.

Last chunk: a shiver.  “I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did you speak?”  “Not I!” said the Lory hastily.  “I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”  “Found _what_?” said the Duck.  “Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what ‘it’ means.”  “I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?”  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.  “As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.”  “In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—”  “Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.  “What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that the best thing to get us dry would
