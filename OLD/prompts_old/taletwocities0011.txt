Story so far: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition.

For I’m a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now let’s look at you.”  The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
