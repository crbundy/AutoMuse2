Story so far: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience.

Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.  The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.  “Tst!
