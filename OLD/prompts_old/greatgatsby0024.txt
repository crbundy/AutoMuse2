Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a scene in which the characters are discussing a trip to New York. Daisy's affection for Nick is described, as well as her admiration for his resemblance to a rose. The passage also describes a dinner party where one of the guests, a woman, starts singing. Tom, the host, tells her that he wants to take her to the stables after dinner. The woman then gets a phone call and the subject of the stables is dropped. The dinner party ends awkwardly, with the horses never being mentioned again. The woman tells Nick that she is very cynical and that she believes that it is better for a girl to be a fool than anything else. The passage describes the summer night and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air.Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, and the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud. But above the grey land and the drifting dust, you can see the blue and gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.

Last chunk: unquiet darkness.                                     II  About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.  But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.  The valley of ashes is
