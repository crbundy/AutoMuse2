Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

Story so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new. The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. Basil Hallward is looking at a portrait of a young man that he has painted, and Lord Henry compliments him on it. Basil says that he doesn't want to send it to any art galleries. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the idea that people enjoy secrecy and deception in their lives, and that this can make life more interesting.

Last chunk: be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”  “Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward.  “Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”  “But why not?”  “Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”  “Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact, than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she
