Outline: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a story about the French Revolution. The story begins in 1775 and is set in London and Paris. The main characters are Dr. Manette, Lucie Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. Dr. Manette is a doctor who is released from prison after eighteen years. He is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and they move to Paris. Charles Darnay is a French aristocrat who is accused of being a traitor and is sentenced to death. Sydney Carton is an English lawyer who defends Darnay and falls in love with Lucie. The story is a love story, a story of redemption, and a story of the French Revolution.

Story so far: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The passage describes a scene in which a rider delivers a message to a guard, who then reads it aloud. The message is simply "Recalled to Life," but the guard is surprised by it. The rider then leaves, and the other passengers pretend to be asleep. The guard on the coach is worried about the message he heard and decides to investigate. Jerry, left alone, dismounts to take a break and check on his horse.

Last chunk: The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.  “Tom!” softly over the coach roof.  “Hallo, Joe.”  “Did you hear the message?”  “I did, Joe.”  “What did you make of it, Tom?”  “Nothing at all, Joe.”  “That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it myself.”  Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.  “After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won’t trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse
