Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage discusses the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room.

By Jane this       attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth       still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,       hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though       their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in       all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.       It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire       her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to       the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the       first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she       considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered       by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength       of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of       manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.        “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied
