Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. George B. Wilson is the owner of a struggling garage. When Tom and the narrator enter, Wilson seems hopeful that they will buy a car. Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere. Wilson's wife then appears and Tom is immediately struck by her sensual beauty. Tom Buchanan and his girlfriend go to New York to meet up with Nick Carraway, who is Mrs. Wilson's sister's husband. Mrs. Wilson accompanies them in a separate car. Mrs. Wilson changes her dress and buys a few things before getting into a taxi. She tells the driver that she wants to buy a dog, and he takes them to a man selling puppies. They pick out an Airedale. Tom and Mrs. Wilson drive to Fifth Avenue, where they buy an Airedale for ten dollars. They then go to the Wilson's apartment, where Mrs. Wilson plans to have a party.

That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”  “I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”  “That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”  The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.  “Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.  “That dog? That dog’s a boy.”  “It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”  We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.  “Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”  “No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”  “Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”  “Well, I’d like to, but—”  We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.  “I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she
