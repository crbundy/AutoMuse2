Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantastical world where she has adventures with strange creatures. Alice finds a bottle labeled "Drink Me" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.

Alice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.

Alice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly.

Last chunk: great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.”  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!       _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with      Alice’s love_).  Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.  Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.  “You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
