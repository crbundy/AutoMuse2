Outline: In Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is publicly humiliated and forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her dress to mark her as an adulteress. Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in town under an assumed name and begins to plot revenge against the man he believes to be Hester's lover. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is born out of wedlock and Hester is forced to raise her alone. Eventually, the townspeople begin to see Hester as a symbol of strength and resilience, and her husband is revealed to be the true sinner. Hester is finally able to move on with her life and finds happiness with a new husband.

This passage describes the arrival of ships at Salem's port, and the bustle that ensues. The port is not as busy as it used to be, but on days when several ships arrive at once, there is a lot of activity. The people who come to the port include the shipmasters and the ship owners. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. The passage describes a room in a seaport town, inhabited by old men who are retired Custom-House officers. The room is dirty and cluttered, and it is clear that it is not regularly cleaned.

His son, too, inherited the persecuting spirit, and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches, that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him. So deep a stain, indeed, that his old dry bones, in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retain it, if they have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven for their cruelties; or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them, in another state of being.
