Story so far: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The passage describes a scene in which a rider delivers a message to a guard, who then reads it aloud. The message is simply "Recalled to Life," but the guard is surprised by it. The rider then leaves, and the other passengers pretend to be asleep. The guard on the coach is worried about the message he heard and decides to investigate. Jerry, left alone, dismounts to take a break and check on his horse. The passage reflects on the idea that every person is a mystery to everyone else, and that this is something that can be both wonderful and terrible. It also notes that sometimes things are hidden from us that we can never know about.

A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was
