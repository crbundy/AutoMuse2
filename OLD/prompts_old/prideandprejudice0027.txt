When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure.

Story so far: The passage discuss the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room.

The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well.

This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with.

If the dispositions of the parties are ever so       well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does       not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to       grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of       vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the       defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”        “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it       is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”        Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,       Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming       an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy       had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at       her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he       looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it       clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good       feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark       eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.       Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure       of
