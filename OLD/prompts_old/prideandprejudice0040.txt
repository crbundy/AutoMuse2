Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Elizabeth is walking to Meryton when she is joined by her sisters Catherine and Lydia. They walk quickly and eventually part ways, with Elizabeth continuing on alone. She arrives at her destination with tired feet and a face flushed from the exercise. Elizabeth is surprised to find Jane at breakfast with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, who seem to disapprove of her having walked three miles in the cold. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Hurst are also there. Elizabeth enquires after her sister and is taken to see her immediately. Jane is delighted to see her but is too ill to speak much.

That she should have walked three miles so early in the       day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible       to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that       they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very       politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was       something better than politeness; there was good humour and       kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at       all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy       which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the       occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was       thinking only of his breakfast.        Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.       Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and       not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken       to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the       fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note       how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her       entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and       when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little       beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness       she was
