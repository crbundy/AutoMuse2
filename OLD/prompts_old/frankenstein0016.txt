Story so far: The author describes his excitement and preparations for an upcoming voyage to explore unvisited regions. He is aware of the risks involved, but feels that the rewards are worth it. The author describes an accident at sea and says that he hopes nothing worse will happen on the voyage. A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship. He is in a terrible state, but is revived and brought into the ship. The lieutenant asks him why he came so far on the ice, and he replies that he is seeking someone who fled from him. The stranger is excited by the prospect of seeing the other sledge again, but is too weak to be on deck. The narrator has promised to keep watch for him.

Last chunk: me.”  “And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”  “Yes.”  “Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”  This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”  “Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”  “And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”  Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear
