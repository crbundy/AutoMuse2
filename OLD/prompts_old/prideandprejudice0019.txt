Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man, is moving into the neighborhood. Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive.

On the       strength of Darcy’s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and       of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was       the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was       clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.       In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually       giving offence.        The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no       stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as       to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.       Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest, and from none received either       attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,       but she smiled too much.        Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they       admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to
