Story so far: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience. The Dover mail is struggling up a hill, and the passengers are getting impatient. The coachman and guard are both worried about a horse that is approaching at a gallop.

The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.  The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.  “So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand! I shall fire!”  The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”  “Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”  “_Is_ that the Dover mail?”  “Why do you want to know?”  “I want a
