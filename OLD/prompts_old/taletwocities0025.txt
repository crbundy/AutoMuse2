Story so far: The passage describes a man's experience of seeing a ghost, which is actually a figment of his imagination. The man is tired and falls asleep, during which time he imagines the ghostly face of a person he once knew. This person was buried 18 years ago and the man imagines him coming back to life. The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. A man arrives at Tellsons Bank in London and asks for accommodation to be prepared for a young lady who may arrive at any time during the day. This passage describes the waiter's observations of the guest's travel habits. The waiter notes that the guest has not traveled much in recent years, and surmises that the guest must have traveled a lot in the past. The waiter also speculates that the guest's home country (France) must be prosperous, based on the fact that the guest works for a successful company.

The waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellsons. When the gentleman from Tellsons entered Miss Manette's apartment, he saw a young lady of not more than seventeen standing by the table between two tall candles.

The gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment. It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.  The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring
