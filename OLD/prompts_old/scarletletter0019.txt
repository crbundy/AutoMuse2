Outline: In Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is publicly humiliated and forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her dress to mark her as an adulteress. Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in town under an assumed name and begins to plot revenge against the man he believes to be Hester's lover. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is born out of wedlock and Hester is forced to raise her alone. Eventually, the townspeople begin to see Hester as a symbol of strength and resilience, and her husband is revealed to be the true sinner. Hester is finally able to move on with her life and finds happiness with a new husband.

This passage describes the connection that a family has to a specific location, even if they have no personal attachment to the place. This is because the family has likely been living in the same place for generations, and the connection is passed down through the family. The narrator feels a strong attachment to Salem, even though he recognizes that it is not a particularly healthy place to live. He has left Salem multiple times before, but always feels drawn back. When he takes a job in the town, he feels like he is fulfilling a destiny. This passage describes the author's experience taking charge of the Salem Custom-House. He notes that most of the employees are old, experienced sea captains. He also mentions that the previous chief executive officer, General Miller, was a very conservative man. The passage describes the retirement of several older customs officers, who were allowed to leave their posts due to their age and infirmity. The author suggests that their retirement may have been due to his own interference, and notes that neither the front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise.

Though by no means less liable than their fellow-men to age and infirmity, they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay. Two or three of their number, as I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic, or perhaps bedridden, never dreamed of making their appearance at the Custom-House, during a large part of the year; but, after a torpid winter, would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, go lazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure and convenience, betake themselves to bed again. I must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic. They were allowed, on my representation, to rest from their arduous labors, and soon afterwards—as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their country’s service, as I verily believe it was—withdrew to a better world. It is a pious consolation to me, that, through my interference, a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which, as a matter of course, every Custom-House officer must be supposed to fall. Neither the front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise.  The greater part
