Outline: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a story about the French Revolution. The story begins in 1775 and is set in London and Paris. The main characters are Dr. Manette, Lucie Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. Dr. Manette is a doctor who is released from prison after eighteen years. He is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and they move to Paris. Charles Darnay is a French aristocrat who is accused of being a traitor and is sentenced to death. Sydney Carton is an English lawyer who defends Darnay and falls in love with Lucie. The story is a love story, a story of redemption, and a story of the French Revolution.

Story so far: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience.

Last chunk: horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.  Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.  The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience
