Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantastical world where she has adventures with strange creatures. Alice finds a bottle labeled "Drink Me" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.

Alice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.

Alice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is.

Last chunk: in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.  “I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and
