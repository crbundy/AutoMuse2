Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

Story so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art, how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography. It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The mind of a well-informed person is like a bric-a-brac shop, full of dust and monsters, the author says. They think that their friend has changed and become less attractive to them. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry Wotton that he does not want him to meet Dorian Gray, as he is the only person who gives his art whatever charm it possesses. Dorian Gray is sitting at a piano, turning the pages of a book of music. He tells his friend Basil that he wants to learn the piece, and Basil says it depends on how Dorian sits. Dorian says he is tired of sitting and does not want a life-sized portrait of himself. When he sees Lord Henry, he blushes and starts to get up. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he is one of Lady Agatha's favorites, and Dorian says he is in her black books at the moment. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he will make peace with Lady Agatha.

Last chunk: they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s “Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming.”  “That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”  “Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”  “This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you have spoiled everything.”  “You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am afraid, one of her victims also.”  “I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to have played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”  “Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you. And I don’t think it really matters about your not
