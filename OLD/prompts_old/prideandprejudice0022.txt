Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage describes the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth.

Last chunk: _tolerable_.”        “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his       ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last       night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once       opening his lips.”        “Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said       Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”        “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and       he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very       angry at being spoke to.”        “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much       unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is       remarkably agreeable.”        “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very       agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how       it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare       say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,       and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”        “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,       “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”        “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with       _him_, if I were you.”        “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with       him.”        “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as       pride
