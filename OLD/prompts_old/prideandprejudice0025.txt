Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage discusses the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement.

If a woman conceals her       affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose       the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor       consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so       much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it       is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a       slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us       who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.       In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection       than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may       never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”        “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If       _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton       indeed not to discover it too.”        “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you       do.”        “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to       conceal it, he must find it out.”        “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley       and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours       together; and as they always see each other in large mixed       parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in
