Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure.

Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him.

Mrs. Bennet said only,       “Nonsense, nonsense!”        “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.       “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that       is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you       _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep       reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”        Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.        “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return       to Mr. Bingley.”        “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.        “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so       before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not       have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually       paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”        The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of       Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first       tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she       had expected all the while.        “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!
