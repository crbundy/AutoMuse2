Story so far: The passage describes a man's experience of seeing a ghost, which is actually a figment of his imagination. The man is tired and falls asleep, during which time he imagines the ghostly face of a person he once knew. This person was buried 18 years ago and the man imagines him coming back to life. The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. The passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. The daughter is shocked and disbelieved, and Mr. Lorry tries to comfort her. He tells her that her father has been found under a different name. The passage describes a woman who appears to be in a trance, and the man who is with her is worried that he will hurt her if he tries to move her. He calls for help, and a wild-looking woman comes over. A figure scolds the inn servants for not fetching things and orders them to bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar. The figure tenderly cares for the patient, calling her "my precious" and "my bird." The figure is angry with Mr. Lorry, accusing him of frightening the patient. A cask of wine has fallen and broken in the street, and people are taking advantage of the situation to drink as much of the wine as they can. Mr. Lorry, observing the scene, hopes that the young woman he is with will not be similarly tempted. People in the street were drinking wine and having a good time. When the wine was gone, they raked the ground where it had been and went on their way.

Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’ mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.  A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations
