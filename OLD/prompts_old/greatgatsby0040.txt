Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York. The figure of Mr. Gatsby is standing alone, looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him. The passage also describes the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage.

On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.  Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.  At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.
