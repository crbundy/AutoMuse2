Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: A wealthy young man from up north, Mr. Bingley, is moving into the neighborhood and Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him. However, Mr. Bennet is not interested and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. The passage describes Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased.

You had better return to your       partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with       me.”        Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and       Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She       told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for       she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in       anything ridiculous.        The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.       Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the       Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she       had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified       by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.       Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned       to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough       to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet       learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good       spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which       they were
