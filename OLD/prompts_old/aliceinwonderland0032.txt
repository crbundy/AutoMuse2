Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole and has adventures in a fantastical world. Along the way, she wonders about her identity and whether she has been changed into someone else. Ultimately, she decides that she would rather stay in the fantastical world than go back to the real world. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small. She wonders how she will grow up again, and decides she needs to eat or drink something. Alice meets a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah and they have a conversation. The caterpillar asks Alice who she is and Alice replies that she doesn't quite know, as she feels she has changed several times since that morning. The caterpillar tells Alice to explain herself and Alice tries, but finds she cannot because she doesn't understand it herself.

Last chunk: blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.     CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar   The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.  “Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”  “What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”  “I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”  “I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.  “I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely, “for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
