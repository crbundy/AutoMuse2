Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has various adventures. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world, and the Caterpillar comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. The caterpillar tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her. The Pigeon is complaining about the serpents, and Alice is trying to explain that she is not a serpent. The Pigeon is not convinced. Alice comes across a house in a clearing and wonders how to get to the garden. She is hesitant to approach the house because she doesn't want to frighten whoever lives there. She eventually decides to approach the house and is greeted by two footmen. One of the footmen has a letter for the Duchess, which Alice is curious about. The Footman tells Alice that it is useless to knock on the door because he is on the same side as she is. He also says that there is so much noise going on inside that no one would be able to hear her anyway.

Last chunk: from the Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.  “There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.  “Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”  “There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer
