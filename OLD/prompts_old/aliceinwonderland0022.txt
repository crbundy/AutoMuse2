Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has adventures. Along the way, she wonders about her identity and whether she has been changed into someone else. Ultimately, she decides that she would rather stay in the world she is in than go back to the real world. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: “Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.  “I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she
