Story so far: The passage describes a man's experience of seeing a ghost, which is actually a figment of his imagination. The man is tired and falls asleep, during which time he imagines the ghostly face of a person he once knew. This person was buried 18 years ago and the man imagines him coming back to life. The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. A man arrives at Tellsons Bank in London and asks for accommodation to be prepared for a young lady who may arrive at any time during the day. This passage describes the waiter's observations of the guest's travel habits. The waiter notes that the guest has not traveled much in recent years, and surmises that the guest must have traveled a lot in the past. The waiter also speculates that the guest's home country (France) must be prosperous, based on the fact that the guest works for a successful company. Mr. Lorry is waiting in a coffee-room for his dinner, and he is thinking about the recent events in his life. He hears a rattling of wheels outside, and he knows that it is Mamselle, the Frenchwoman he has been helping.

Last chunk: coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.  As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to cloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.  A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work. Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.  He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.  In a very few minutes
