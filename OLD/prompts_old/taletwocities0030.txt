Story so far: The passage describes a man's experience of seeing a ghost, which is actually a figment of his imagination. The man is tired and falls asleep, during which time he imagines the ghostly face of a person he once knew. This person was buried 18 years ago and the man imagines him coming back to life. The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. A young woman needs to go to Paris for business, and she asks a gentleman from the bank to accompany her. He agrees, and tells her that the business is of a surprising nature. A man tells a story about one of his customers, a French gentleman from Beauvais. The passage describes a man's lack of feelings and emotions, and how he has been a trustee for many customers over the years.

No; you have been the ward of Tellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle.”  After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.  “So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when he did--Don’t be frightened! How you start!”  She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.  “Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of business. As I was saying--”  Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:  “As I was saying; if Monsieur
