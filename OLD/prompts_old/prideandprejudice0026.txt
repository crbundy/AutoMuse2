Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage discusses the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well.

When she is       secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as       much as she chooses.”        “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is       in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were       determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I       should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not       acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the       degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known       him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;       she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined       in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make       her understand his character.”        “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she       might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but       you must remember that four evenings have been also spent       together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”        “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that       they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to       any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has       been unfolded.”        “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;       and if she were married to him to-
