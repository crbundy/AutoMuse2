Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

Story so far: This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful.

The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family. In the passage, two men discuss Mr. Dorian Gray. One man says that he sees Mr. Gray every day and that he is absolutely necessary to him. The other man is surprised, as he thought the first man only cared about his art.

Last chunk: agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”  Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray. How often do you see him?”  “Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is absolutely necessary to me.”  “How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but your art.”  “He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the
