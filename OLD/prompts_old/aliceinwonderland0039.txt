Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has adventures and wonders about her identity. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world rather than return to the real world. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended. The caterpillar then tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her. The Pigeon is complaining about the serpents, and Alice is trying to explain that she is not a serpent. The Pigeon is not convinced. Alice encounters a pigeon who accuses her of being a serpent in disguise. Alice denies this, but the pigeon insists that all serpents must eat eggs. This frustrates Alice, who is not looking for eggs.

Last chunk: no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”  “I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”  “I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”  “It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want _yours_: I don’t like them raw.”  “Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself,
