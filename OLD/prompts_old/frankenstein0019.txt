Outline: A young scientist, Victor Frankenstein, becomes obsessed with creating life. He eventually succeeds in creating a creature, but when he sees what he has done, he flees in horror.

The creature seeks revenge on his creator by destroying everything Frankenstein holds dear. In the end, Frankenstein destroys the creature he created, but not before the creature destroys him.

Story so far: The speaker is talking to someone else about their shared interest in a project, and how excited they are about it. The other person suddenly becomes very emotional, and the speaker wonders if they are also "mad" with excitement. The other person then says they will share their story, which the speaker is very curious to hear. The passage describes a conversation between two people, in which the stranger confides in the narrator about his sorrowful past. The stranger expresses his belief that everyone deserves to have a friend, and the narrator agrees. The stranger then goes on to say that he once had a friend who was the most noble of creatures, but he has since lost everything and feels hopeless. The stranger is moved by the beauty of nature, even though he is broken in spirit.

But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.”  As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.  Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still
