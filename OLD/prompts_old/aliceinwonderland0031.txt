Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole and has adventures in a fantastical world. Along the way, she wonders about her identity and whether she has been changed into someone else. Ultimately, she decides that she would rather stay in the fantastical world than go back to the real world. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.  “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?”  The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the
