Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. Miss Bingley sends a note to Miss Bennet, asking her to come have dinner so they can avoid quarrelling.

Last chunk: think about officers any more than we do.       I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,       indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,       with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I       shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked       very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his       regimentals.”        “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and       Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did       when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in       Clarke’s library.”        Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman       with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the       servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with       pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter       read,        “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?       Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”        “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.        “MY DEAR FRIEND,—       “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa       and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest       of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women       can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the       receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine
