Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has adventures and wonders about her identity. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world rather than return to the real world. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.  “What size do you want to be?” it asked.  “Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”  “I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.  Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.  “Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.  “Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”  “It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).  “But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought
