Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage describes the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room.

To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather       believe he _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know       what—something about Mr. Robinson.”        “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;       did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he       liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there       were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he       thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last       question—‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there       cannot be two opinions on that point.’”        “Upon my word! Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem       as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”        “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,”       said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as       his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just
