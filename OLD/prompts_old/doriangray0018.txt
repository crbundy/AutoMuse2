Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

Story so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family. The passage discusses the relationship between an artist and their art, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography. The artist in the passage argues that this is not the case, and that art should be separate from the artist's personal life. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The mind of a well-informed person is like a bric-a-brac shop, full of dust and monsters, the author says. They think that their friend has changed and become less attractive to them.

Last chunk: doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a _bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.”  “Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change too often.”  “Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette
