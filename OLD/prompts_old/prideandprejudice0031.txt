Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party. Mr. Darcy is standing near them, looking disapproving. Sir William Lucas comments on how much he enjoys dancing, and Mr. Darcy agrees that it is a pleasant activity. This passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Sir William, in which Sir William tries to convince Darcy to dance with Elizabeth. Darcy is hesitant, but Sir William persists and eventually Darcy agrees. Elizabeth, however, is not interested in dancing with Darcy and quickly turns him down.

Last chunk: you often dance at St. James’s?”        “Never, sir.”        “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”        “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid       it.”        “You have a house in town, I conclude?”        Mr. Darcy bowed.        “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am       fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that       the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”        He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not       disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving       towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very       gallant thing, and called out to her,        “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must       allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable       partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much       beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given       it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not       unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said       with some discomposure to Sir William,        “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I       entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg       for a partner.”        Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the       honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor       did Sir William at all
