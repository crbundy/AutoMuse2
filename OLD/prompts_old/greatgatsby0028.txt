Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. George B. Wilson is the owner of a struggling garage. When Tom and the narrator enter, Wilson seems hopeful that they will buy a car. Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere. Wilson's wife then appears and Tom is immediately struck by her sensual beauty. Tom Buchanan and his girlfriend go to New York to meet up with Nick Carraway, who is Mrs. Wilson's sister's husband. Mrs. Wilson accompanies them in a separate car. Mrs. Wilson changes her dress and buys a few things before getting into a taxi. She tells the driver that she wants to buy a dog, and he takes them to a man selling puppies. They pick out an Airedale.

Last chunk: sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.  She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.  “I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”  We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.  “What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.  “All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”  “I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”  The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.  “That’s no police dog,” said Tom.  “No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown
