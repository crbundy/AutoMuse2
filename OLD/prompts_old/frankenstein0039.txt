Story so far: The narrator tells the story of their difficult past to a stranger, revealing that they are still waiting for one more event before they can rest in peace. The story includes the narrator's loving and devoted parents, their only child status for many years, and a young girl who is orphaned and taken in by a wealthy family. The passage describes the narrator's happy childhood, during which their sister Elizabeth was a shining light in the family. The passage goes on to describe the narrator's encounter with a man of great research in natural philosophy, which leads the narrator to take up mathematics after a change in mood. However, the narrator's idyllic childhood is eventually shattered by misfortune when the narrator's mother dies. The passage ends with the narrator's resolve to attend university. The speaker reflects on the death of their mother, and how hard it is to accept that she is gone. They talk about the different stages of grief, and how eventually it becomes more of an indulgence than a necessity. Even though it may seem wrong, the speaker says that people eventually start smiling again.

These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished.
