Outline: In Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is publicly humiliated and forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her dress to mark her as an adulteress. Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in town under an assumed name and begins to plot revenge against the man he believes to be Hester's lover. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is born out of wedlock and Hester is forced to raise her alone.

The Collector’s junior clerk, too—a young gentleman who, it was whispered, occasionally covered a sheet of Uncle Sam’s letter-paper with what (at the distance of a few yards) looked very much like poetry—used now and then to speak to me of books, as matters with which I might possibly be conversant. This was my all of lettered intercourse; and it was quite sufficient for my necessities.  No longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blazoned abroad on title-pages, I smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue. The Custom-House marker imprinted it, with a stencil and black paint, on pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise, in testimony that these
