Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: A wealthy young man from up north, Mr. Bingley, is moving into the neighborhood and Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him. However, Mr. Bennet is not interested and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. The passage describes Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,       to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.       Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a       conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance       for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.        “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you       standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much       better dance.”        “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am       particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as       this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and       there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a       punishment to me to stand up with.”        “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,       “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant       girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of       them you see uncommonly pretty.”        “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said       Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.        “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there       is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very       pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner       to introduce you.”        “Which
