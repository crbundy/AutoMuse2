Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has adventures and wonders about her identity. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world rather than return to the real world. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended. The caterpillar then tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink.

Last chunk: of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended!”  “You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.”  “One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to herself.  “Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.  “And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there
