Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure.

I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every       particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two       youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”        “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the       sense of their father and mother.
