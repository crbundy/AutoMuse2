Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: A wealthy young man from up north, Mr. Bingley, is moving into the neighborhood and Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him. However, Mr. Bennet is not interested and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. The passage describes Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him.

The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine       figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than       Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned       the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to       be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his       large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most       forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be       compared with his friend.        Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the       principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,       danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and       talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable       qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him       and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and       once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His       character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man       in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there       again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,       whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into       particular
