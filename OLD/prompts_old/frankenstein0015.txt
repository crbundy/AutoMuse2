Story so far: The author describes his excitement and preparations for an upcoming voyage to explore unvisited regions. He is aware of the risks involved, but feels that the rewards are worth it. The author describes an accident at sea and says that he hopes nothing worse will happen on the voyage. A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship.

When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.  His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, â€œTo seek one who fled from
