Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of       passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and       was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir       William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.        “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!

I consider it as one of       the first refinements of polished societies.”        “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue       amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage       can dance.”        Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he       continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I       doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.       Darcy.”        “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”        “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the       sight.
