Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure.

The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Elizabeth is walking to Meryton when she is joined by her sisters Catherine and Lydia. They walk quickly and eventually part ways, with Elizabeth continuing on alone. She arrives at her destination with tired feet and a face flushed from the exercise.

The apothecary       came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be       supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must       endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,       and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,       for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.       Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other       ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact       nothing to do elsewhere.        When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and       very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,       and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane       testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at Netherfield for the present.
