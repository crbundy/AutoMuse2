Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. George B.

Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere. Wilson's wife then appears and Tom is immediately struck by her sensual beauty. Tom Buchanan and his girlfriend go to New York to meet up with Nick Carraway, who is Mrs. Wilson's sister's husband. Mrs. Wilson accompanies them in a separate car.

Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:  “Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”  “Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.  “I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”  “All right.”  “I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”  She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.  We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.  “Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.  “Awful.”  “It does her good to get away.”  “Doesn’t her husband object?”  “Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”  So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the
