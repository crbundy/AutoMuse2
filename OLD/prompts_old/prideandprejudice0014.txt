Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: A wealthy young man from up north, Mr. Bingley, is moving into the neighborhood and Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him. However, Mr. Bennet is not interested and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. The passage describes Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this.

Last chunk: the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still       up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present       occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an       evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had       rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story       to hear.        “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a       most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had       been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.       Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her       quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,       my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only       creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,       he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;       but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,       you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going       down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,       and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with       Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth       with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the       _Boulanger_—”        “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband       impatiently,
