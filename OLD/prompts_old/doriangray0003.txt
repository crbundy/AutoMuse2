Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

Story so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new. The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees.

Last chunk: the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.  All art is quite useless.  OSCAR WILDE     CHAPTER I.   The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.  From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant
