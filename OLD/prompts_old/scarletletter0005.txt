Outline: In Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is publicly humiliated and forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her dress to mark her as an adulteress. Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in town under an assumed name and begins to plot revenge against the man he believes to be Hester's lover. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is born out of wedlock and Hester is forced to raise her alone. Eventually, the townspeople begin to see Hester as a symbol of strength and resilience, and her husband is revealed to be the true sinner. Hester is finally able to move on with her life and finds happiness with a new husband.

Story so far:  This passage explains the terms of use for the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The eBook is free to use for anyone in the United States, with few restrictions. Those outside of the United States must check their local laws before using the eBook. The author of The Scarlet Letter was surprised and amused to find that his sketch of official life in the preface to the second edition had caused an unprecedented amount of excitement among the respectable people around him. He insists that he did not mean to offend anyone and that the sketch was simply meant to be a frank and accurate portrayal of his impressions of the characters described therein. The author of "The Custom House" republishes his introductory sketch without changes, noting that he believes he has done so in the best possible way. The contents of the book are then listed. The passage describes the different illustrations in the book. The narrator talks about how he twice felt the need to write about his life, once when he was living in the Old Manse, and now again. He talks about how he has always been reticent to talk about himself, but feels compelled to do so now.
