Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

Story so far: This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family. In the passage, two men discuss Mr. Dorian Gray. One man says that he sees Mr. Gray every day and that he is absolutely necessary to him. The other man is surprised, as he thought the first man only cared about his art. The passage discusses how the author's new muse, Dorian Gray, has inspired a fresh approach to art. The artist sees Dorian as the embodiment of a new school of thought that combines the passion of the romantic spirit with the perfection of the Greek spirit.

Last chunk: second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of thought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two,
