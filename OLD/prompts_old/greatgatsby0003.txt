Story so far:  This passage is from the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The eBook is available for free to anyone in the United States and most other parts of the world, with few restrictions. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a man who is trying to win back the love of his life. The author reflects on some advice they received to not be so quick to judge others, and how this has led to them learning more about people. However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with. The narrator reflects on how, after returning from the East last autumn, he wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever. He exempts Gatsby from this feeling, because Gatsby represents everything the narrator has an unaffected scorn for. The narrator describes Gatsby as having an extraordinary gift for hope and a romantic readiness that he has never found in any other person. At the end of the passage, the narrator reflects on how Gatsby turned out all right in the end, despite the challenges he faced.

This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations.
