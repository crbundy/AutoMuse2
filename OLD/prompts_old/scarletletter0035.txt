Outline: In Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is publicly humiliated and forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her dress to mark her as an adulteress. Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in town under an assumed name and begins to plot revenge against the man he believes to be Hester's lover. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is born out of wedlock and Hester is forced to raise her alone. Eventually, the townspeople begin to see Hester as a symbol of strength and resilience, and her husband is revealed to be the true sinner. Hester is finally able to move on with her life and finds happiness with a new husband.

A stain on his conscience, as to anything that came within the range of his vocation, would trouble such a man very much in the same way, though to a far greater degree, that an error in the balance of an account or an ink-blot on the fair page of a book of record. Here, in a word,—and it is a rare instance in my life,—I had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held.  Such were some of the people with whom I now found myself connected. I took it in good part, at the hands of Providence, that I was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits, and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had.
