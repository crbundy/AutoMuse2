Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

Story so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art, how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography. It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The mind of a well-informed person is like a bric-a-brac shop, full of dust and monsters, the author says. They think that their friend has changed and become less attractive to them. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry Wotton that he does not want him to meet Dorian Gray, as he is the only person who gives his art whatever charm it possesses. Dorian Gray is sitting at a piano, turning the pages of a book of music. He tells his friend Basil that he wants to learn the piece, and Basil says it depends on how Dorian sits. Dorian says he is tired of sitting and does not want a life-sized portrait of himself. When he sees Lord Henry, he blushes and starts to get up. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he is one of Lady Agatha's favorites, and Dorian says he is in her black books at the moment. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he will make peace with Lady Agatha. Aunt Agatha makes a lot of noise when she plays the piano, and Dorian finds it annoying. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he is too charming to be philanthropic, and Basil asks Lord Henry to leave so he can finish his painting.

Last chunk: being there. The audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”  “That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian, laughing.  Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.  “You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too charming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case.  The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said, “Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”  Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he asked.  “Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”  “I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I
