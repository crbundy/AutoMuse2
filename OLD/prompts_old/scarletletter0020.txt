Outline: In Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is publicly humiliated and forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her dress to mark her as an adulteress. Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in town under an assumed name and begins to plot revenge against the man he believes to be Hester's lover. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is born out of wedlock and Hester is forced to raise her alone. Eventually, the townspeople begin to see Hester as a symbol of strength and resilience, and her husband is revealed to be the true sinner. Hester is finally able to move on with her life and finds happiness with a new husband.
