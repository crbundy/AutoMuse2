Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that a wealthy young man from up north is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting him, but his wife insists. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. The passage describes Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive.

At our time of       life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new       acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do       anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare       say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”        “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the       youngest, I’m the tallest.”        The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he       would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should       ask him to dinner.     Chapter 3        Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her       five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw       from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.
