Story so far: The passage describes a man's experience of seeing a ghost, which is actually a figment of his imagination. The man is tired and falls asleep, during which time he imagines the ghostly face of a person he once knew. This person was buried 18 years ago and the man imagines him coming back to life. The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. The passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. The daughter is shocked and disbelieved, and Mr. Lorry tries to comfort her. He tells her that her father has been found under a different name. The passage describes a woman who appears to be in a trance, and the man who is with her is worried that he will hurt her if he tries to move her. He calls for help, and a wild-looking woman comes over. A figure scolds the inn servants for not fetching things and orders them to bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar. The figure tenderly cares for the patient, calling her "my precious" and "my bird." The figure is angry with Mr. Lorry, accusing him of frightening the patient. A cask of wine has fallen and broken in the street, and people are taking advantage of the situation to drink as much of the wine as they can. Mr. Lorry, observing the scene, hopes that the young woman he is with will not be similarly tempted.

My darling pretty!”  “I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”  “A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?”  This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.     CHAPTER V. The Wine-shop   A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.  All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip,
