Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a scene in which the characters are discussing a trip to New York. Daisy's affection for Nick is described, as well as her admiration for his resemblance to a rose. The passage also describes a dinner party where one of the guests, a woman, starts singing.

The dinner party ends awkwardly, with the horses never being mentioned again. The woman tells Nick that she is very cynical and that she believes that it is better for a girl to be a fool than anything else.

We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”  “That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”  “It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”  “But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”  Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.  Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his
