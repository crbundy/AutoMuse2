Outline: Alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.

Story so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has adventures and wonders about her identity. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world rather than return to the real world. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended. The caterpillar then tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her.

And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?” She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.  “Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.  “I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”  “Serpent, I say
