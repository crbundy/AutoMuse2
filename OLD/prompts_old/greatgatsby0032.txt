Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. Tom and Myrtle reappear after disappearing for a while, and company starts to arrive at their apartment. Catherine is a slender woman with red hair, and Mr. McKee is a photographer. Mrs. Wilson is a woman who is very proud of her husband's photographic work. She has recently changed her outfit to a cream-coloured dress and her personality has changed as well. She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it.

She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.

With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.  “My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”  “What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.  “Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”  “I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”  Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.  “It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”  “But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,”
