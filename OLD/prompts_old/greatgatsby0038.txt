Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage and regrets ever marrying her husband. She says she only married him because she thought he was a gentleman, but he has turned out to be anything but. Myrtle's husband has been having an affair with Catherine's husband, Tom, and Myrtle says she is the first sweetie he's ever had. The passage describes the narrator's feelings of being both inside and outside of the conversations going on around him. He is pulled back into his chair by the argument, but he sees someone else looking up at the building. Myrtle tells the story of her first meeting with Tom.

Mr. McKee falls asleep, and the little dog is sitting on the table looking through the smoke. Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson get into a discussion and he ends up breaking her nose.

Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.  The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.  “Daisy! Daisy!
