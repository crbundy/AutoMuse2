Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.

A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.  Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and smiled.  “I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in.
