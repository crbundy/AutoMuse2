The main characters are Dr. Manette, Lucie Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. Dr. Manette is a doctor who is released from prison after eighteen years. He is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and they move to Paris. Charles Darnay is a French aristocrat who is accused of being a traitor and is sentenced to death. Sydney Carton is an English lawyer who defends Darnay and falls in love with Lucie. The story is a love story, a story of redemption, and a story of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes a man's experience of seeing a ghost, which is actually a figment of his imagination. The man is tired and falls asleep, during which time he imagines the ghostly face of a person he once knew. This person was buried 18 years ago and the man imagines him coming back to life. The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. A man arrives at Tellsons Bank in London and asks for accommodation to be prepared for a young lady who may arrive at any time during the day.

Last chunk: sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.  Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:  “I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”  “Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”  “Yes.”  “Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards
