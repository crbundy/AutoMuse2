Outline: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a story about the French Revolution. The story begins in 1775 and is set in London and Paris. The main characters are Dr. Manette, Lucie Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. Dr. Manette is a doctor who is released from prison after eighteen years. He is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and they move to Paris. Charles Darnay is a French aristocrat who is accused of being a traitor and is sentenced to death. Sydney Carton is an English lawyer who defends Darnay and falls in love with Lucie. The story is a love story, a story of redemption, and a story of the French Revolution.

As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.  There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring
