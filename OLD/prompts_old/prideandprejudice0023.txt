Outline: In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is determined to see them all married. When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.

Story so far: The passage describes the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle.

Last chunk: often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot       wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,       everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I       may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”        “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily       forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”        “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of       her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all       that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common       indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that       there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of       self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or       imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the       words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without       being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,       vanity to what we would have others think of us.”        “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came       with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would       keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”        “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said       Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away       your bottle directly.”        The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare
