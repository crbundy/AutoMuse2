Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. Tom and Myrtle reappear after disappearing for a while, and company starts to arrive at their apartment. Catherine is a slender woman with red hair, and Mr. McKee is a photographer. Mrs. Wilson is a woman who is very proud of her husband's photographic work. She has recently changed her outfit to a cream-coloured dress and her personality has changed as well. She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it. Mrs. McKee is being pursued by Mr. McKee.

The first woman says that she is scared of her neighbor, who is a wealthy man named Gatsbys. The second woman says that she does not understand why people stay married to someone if they cannot stand them.

I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”  This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:  “Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.  “I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”  “Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”  “Do what?” she asked, startled.  “You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.”  Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:  “Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”  “Can’t they?”  “Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them?
