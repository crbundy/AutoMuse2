Outline: The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York City in 1922 to pursue his career. He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.

Story so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. Tom and Myrtle reappear after disappearing for a while, and company starts to arrive at their apartment. Catherine is a slender woman with red hair, and Mr. McKee is a photographer. Mrs. Wilson is a woman who is very proud of her husband's photographic work. She has recently changed her outfit to a cream-coloured dress and her personality has changed as well. She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it. Mrs. McKee is being pursued by Mr. McKee.

Last chunk: pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”  We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  “I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”  “I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”  Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.  “You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”  “I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.  “I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.  Tom looked at him blankly.  “Two of them we have framed downstairs.”  “Two what?” demanded Tom.  “Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”  The sister Catherine
