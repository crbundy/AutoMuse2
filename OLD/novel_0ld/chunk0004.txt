You think somebody else did it?" asked the partner.

"I think so," said the detective.

The detective and his partner walked down the street together.

"I'm going to check the place out," said the detective.

"Who do you think did it?" asked the partner.

"I don't know," said the detective. "But I'm going to find out."

The detective walked into a nearby apartment building. He walked up to the second floor and knocked on a door. After a moment, the door opened.

"Hello, Mrs. Turner," said the detective. "I'm here about your husband."

"Come in, Mr. Holmes," said Mrs. Turner.

The detective and his partner walked into the apartment. Mrs. Turner was a middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. She led them into the living room and offered them a seat.

"Would you like some coffee?" she asked.

"That would be wonderful, thank you," said the detective.

"How do you take it?" asked Mrs. Turner.

"Black, please," said the detective.

Mrs. Turner went into the kitchen to make the coffee. The detective looked around the room. It was a nice apartment, with a large bay window and hardwood floors.

"How have you been doing since the incident, Mrs. Turner?"
