Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away.
