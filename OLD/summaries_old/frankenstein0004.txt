The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves.

However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences.
