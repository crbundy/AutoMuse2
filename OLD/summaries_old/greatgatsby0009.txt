The passage describes a man who is physically strong and imposing, with a gruff voice that conveys a touch of contempt. The man is talking to the narrator on a porch, pointing out the features of his home. He is polite but abrupt, and the narrator gets the impression that he is not entirely comfortable in his own skin.
