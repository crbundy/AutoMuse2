The passage reflects on the transitory nature of life, and how a man of thought and sensibility can be a good man of affairs if he chooses to be. The author notes that his fellow officers and others he knows through his work know him only in his professional capacity, and probably wouldn't care for him more if they knew of his literary aspirations. The point is made that it is a good lesson for a man who dreamed of literary fame to learn that it is not necessary for success in life.
