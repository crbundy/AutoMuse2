This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth.
