The passage describes an old warrior in terms of the nobility and heroism that characterized him. The narrator notes that the warrior's spirit would have required an impulse to get him moving, but once stirred up, he would not have given up or failed. The heat that had formerly been a part of his nature was still present, even in his decline.
