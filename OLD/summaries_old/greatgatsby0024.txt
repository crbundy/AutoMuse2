The passage describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air.Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, and the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud. But above the grey land and the drifting dust, you can see the blue and gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.
