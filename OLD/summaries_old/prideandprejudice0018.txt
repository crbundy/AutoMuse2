Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character.
