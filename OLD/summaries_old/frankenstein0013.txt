A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. They watch him for a while, but he eventually disappears into the distance. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship.
