The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle.
