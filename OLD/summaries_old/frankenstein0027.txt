This passage tells the story of a poor child who is different from the other children in her poverty-stricken village. She is thin and fair, with bright golden hair, and is so beautiful that she seems otherworldly. The peasant woman who is caring for her reveals that she is actually the daughter of a Milanese nobleman, and was left with them to nurse.
