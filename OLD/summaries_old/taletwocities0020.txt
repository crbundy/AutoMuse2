The passage describes a cold, wet day, with the sun shining brightly. A passenger comments on how long eighteen years is, and how terrible it would be to be buried alive for that long. The head drawer at the hotel where they are staying opens the door and congratulates the passenger on his journey. The inside of the coach is described as being like a dirty dog kennel, and the passenger is described as looking like a large dog. The drawer tells the passenger that there will be a packet to Calais the next day, and the passenger asks for a bedroom and a barber.
