Dorian Gray is sitting at a piano, turning the pages of a book of music. He tells his friend Basil that he wants to learn the piece, and Basil says it depends on how Dorian sits. Dorian says he is tired of sitting and does not want a life-sized portrait of himself. When he sees Lord Henry, he blushes and starts to get up. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he is one of Lady Agatha's favorites, and Dorian says he is in her black books at the moment. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he will make peace with Lady Agatha.
