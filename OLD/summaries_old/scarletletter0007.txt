The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a "Custom-House sketch" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents.
