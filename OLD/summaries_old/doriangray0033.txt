This passage discusses the word "dreadful," and how it makes the speaker shudder. They feel that women often ruin romances by trying to make them last forever, and that the only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the former lasts longer. As Dorian Gray and Lord Henry enter the studio, Dorian makes a comment about how their friendship should be a caprice. Lord Henry watches him as he resumes his pose and starts painting again. After a while, Hallward stops painting and looks at both the picture and Dorian, before declaring it finished and signing his name on the canvas. Lord Henry comes over to examine the picture and congratulates Hallward on his work.
