The passage describes a dinner party where one of the guests, a woman, starts singing. Tom, the host, tells her that he wants to take her to the stables after dinner. The woman then gets a phone call and the subject of the stables is dropped. The dinner party ends awkwardly, with the horses never being mentioned again.
