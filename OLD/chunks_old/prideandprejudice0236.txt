unconnected       questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of       solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s       happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly       understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she       came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words       seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his       thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an       allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a       little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the       pales opposite the Parsonage.        She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last       letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had       not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by       Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was       meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a       smile, she said:        “I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”        “I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I       generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at       the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?”        “No, I should have turned in a moment.”        And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the       Parsonage together.        “Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
