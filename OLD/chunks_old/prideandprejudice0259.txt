accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what       I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted       veracity.        “Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for       many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose       good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my       father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was       his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.
