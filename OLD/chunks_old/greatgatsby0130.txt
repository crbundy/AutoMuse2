got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”  Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.  “I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.  “Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”  “That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”  “I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”  “Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”  “You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.  Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.  “She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”  At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.  “Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”  “I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”  Tom turned to Daisy sharply.  “You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”  “Not seeing,” said Gatsby.
