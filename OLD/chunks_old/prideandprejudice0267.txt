profligacy which he scrupled not to       lay at Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more       so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never       heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in       which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on       meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight       acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in       Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,       had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of       enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him       at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect       some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity       or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.       Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for       those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what       Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’       continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could       see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;       but she could remember no more substantial good than the general       approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social       powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a       considerable while, she once more continued to read.
