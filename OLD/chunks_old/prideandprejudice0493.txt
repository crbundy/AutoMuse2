thing that is       charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!       What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”        This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be       doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard       only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three       minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.        “My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten       thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord!       And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special       licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is       particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.”        This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the       gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in       the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of       her relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished       for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for       Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law       that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power       to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his       opinion.        Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains       to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that       he was rising every hour in his esteem.
