with her father. What an agreeable man       Sir William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of       fashion! So genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to       everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons       who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,       quite mistake the matter.”        “Did Charlotte dine with you?”        “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the       mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants       that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up       differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the       Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity       they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_       plain—but then she is our particular friend.”        “She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.        “Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas       herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not       like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not       often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do       not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was       a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her,       that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before       we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her       too young.
