means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every       day that where there is affection, young people are seldom       withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into       engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than       so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even       to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise       you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry       to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with       him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.”        “Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so       very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of       inviting him.”        “As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:       “very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do       not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your       account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You       know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company       for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do       what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.”        Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked       her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful       instance of advice being given on such a point, without being       resented.
