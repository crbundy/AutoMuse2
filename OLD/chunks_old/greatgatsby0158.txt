this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”  “That was a long time ago.”  The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.  “Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.  “Which drawer?”  “That drawer—that one.”  Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.  “This?” he inquired, holding it up.  Wilson stared and nodded.  “I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”  “You mean your wife bought it?”  “She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”  Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.  “Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.  “Who did?”  “I have a way of finding out.”  “You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”  “He murdered her.”  “It was an accident, George.”
