enough? Oh,       Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you       quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”        “Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,       when I tell you all.”        “What do you mean?”        “Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I       am afraid you will be angry.”        “My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very       seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without       delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?”        “It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it       began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his       beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”        Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the       desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn       assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss       Bennet had nothing further to wish.        “Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as       myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his       love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as       Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and       yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very       reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at       Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,       not to you.”
