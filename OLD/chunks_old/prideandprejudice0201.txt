disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and       mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when       we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without       being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know       where we have gone—we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes,       mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our       imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular       scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let       _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the       generality of travellers.”     Chapter 28        Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to       Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she       had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her       health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant       source of delight.        When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye       was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to       bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary       on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she       had heard of its inhabitants.        At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to       the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the       laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.
