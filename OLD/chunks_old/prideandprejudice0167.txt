in; thirdly, she       trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,       that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were       plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real       cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been       barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she       principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could       console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out       her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth       without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak       to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months       were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.        Mr. Bennetâ€™s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,       and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most       agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that       Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably       sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his       daughter!        Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she       said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for       their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it       as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,       for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no       other way
