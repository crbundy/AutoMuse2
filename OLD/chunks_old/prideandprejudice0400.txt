very welcome surprise; for his wish at present       was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When       the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in       seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former       indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory       in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged       to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his       brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.        The good news spread quickly through the house, and with       proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in       the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been       more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come       upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded       from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to       be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her       well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old       ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this       change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery       was considered certain.        It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on       this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,       and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a       damp to her triumph.
