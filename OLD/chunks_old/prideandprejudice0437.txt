drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to       make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”        Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.       Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,       therefore, she could not tell.        “It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well       married,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr.       Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.       They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it       seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His       regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving       the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank       Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he       deserves.”        Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such       misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew       from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else       had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he       meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he       believed.        “When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her       mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you       please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy       to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.”
