in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly       flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,       instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy       evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of       their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a       great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of       everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness       anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single       event, or any particular person, for though they each, like       Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he       was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a       ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her       family that she had no disinclination for it.        “While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is       enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening       engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself       one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement       as desirable for everybody.”        Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though       she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could       not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s       invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to       join in the evening’s amusement;
