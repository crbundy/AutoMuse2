the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found       from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their       direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking       over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an       inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his       willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.        “My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have       heard so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many       of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth       there, you know.”        Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at       Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing       it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after       going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or       satin curtains.        Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine       house richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it       myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the       finest woods in the country.”        Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The       possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,       instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very       idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt       than to run such a risk.
