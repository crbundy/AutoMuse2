further.     Chapter 39        It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies       set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in       Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.       Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in       token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking       out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an       hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite       milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad       and cucumber.        After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a       table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually       affords, exclaiming, “Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable       surprise?”        “And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend       us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.”       Then, showing her purchases—“Look here, I have bought this       bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might       as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get       home, and see if I can make it up any better.”        And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect       unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the       shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim       it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.
