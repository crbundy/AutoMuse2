Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him       up, as to believe him capable of it?”        “Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other       neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so!       But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if       that had been the case?”        “In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute       proof that they are not gone to Scotland.”        “Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is       such a presumption!
