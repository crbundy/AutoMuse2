as she entered, and       fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the       least altered by her communication.        “I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she       had finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”        “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.       Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have       Lizzy.”        “And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless       business.”        “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon       her marrying him.”        “Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”        Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the       library.        “Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have       sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.       Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth       replied that it was. “Very well—and this offer of marriage you       have refused?”        “I have, sir.”        “Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon       your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”        “Yes, or I will never see her again.”        “An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day       you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will       never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will       never see you again if you _do_.”
