were worn out, like his       information.        It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so       early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to       Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching       their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to       welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was       pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs       were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their       cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the       drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a       twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and       kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in       bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.        Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object       was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,       in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always       struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of       dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would       not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of       Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated       conversations occurring at different times between Jane and       herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given       up the acquaintance.
