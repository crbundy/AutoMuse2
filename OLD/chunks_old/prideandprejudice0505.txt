indignant on the marriage of her       nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her       character in her reply to the letter which announced its       arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of       Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But       at length, by Elizabethâ€™s persuasion, he was prevailed on to       overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a       little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment       gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to       see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait       on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods       had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress,       but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.        With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.       Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were       both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons       who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of       uniting them.     *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.
