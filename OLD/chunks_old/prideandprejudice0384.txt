this. And it is the more to be       lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte       informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your       daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;       though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and       Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must       be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,       at so early an age.
