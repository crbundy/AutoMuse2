with you.”        Elizabeth was forced to go.        “We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her       mother, as soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up       stairs to sit in my dressing-room.”        Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained       quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then       returned into the drawing-room.        Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was       every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her       daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable       addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged       officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with       a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to       the daughter.        He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he       went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and       Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with       her husband.        After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word       passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went       to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,       unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,       however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have       taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.
