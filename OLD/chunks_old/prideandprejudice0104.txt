be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.”        “It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions       may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.       It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other       feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour       to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”        “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”        “Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give       his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,       and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride—for he is       very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear       to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,       or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful       motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_       brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian       of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the       most attentive and best of brothers.”        “What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”        He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me       pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her       brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and       pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and       hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now.
