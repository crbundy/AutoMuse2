therefore,       he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that       as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to       Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should       consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own       inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object       of her wishes.     Chapter 51        Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt       for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was       sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by       dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,       and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would       have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was       wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.        They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to       receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the       carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably       grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.        Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown       open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,       embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with       an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and       wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of       their happiness.
