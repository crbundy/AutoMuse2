“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”  I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it.

I can’t go through this alone.”  Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.  Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it.
