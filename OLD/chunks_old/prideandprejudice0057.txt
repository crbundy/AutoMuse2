Chapter 10        The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and       Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the       invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the       evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in       attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The       perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting,       or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter,       with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received,       formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her       opinion of each.        “How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”        He made no answer.        “You write uncommonly fast.”
