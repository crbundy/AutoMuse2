no talk of his coming       to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of       everybody, too, who is likely to know.”        “I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”        “Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.       Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and       if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort       is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will       be sorry for what he has done.”        But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such       expectation, she made no answer.        “Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the       Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope       it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is       an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her       mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in       _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.”        “No, nothing at all.”        “A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.       _They_ will take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will       never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!       And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your       father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,       whenever that happens.”        “It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”
