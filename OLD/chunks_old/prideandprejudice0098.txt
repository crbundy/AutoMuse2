You could not have met with a       person more capable of giving you certain information on that       head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a       particular manner from my infancy.”        Elizabeth could not but look surprised.        “You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,       after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our       meeting yesterday.
