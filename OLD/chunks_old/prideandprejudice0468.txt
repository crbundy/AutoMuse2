uneasiness as to the possible consequence of       her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of       her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to       Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;       and how he might take a similar representation of the evils       attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.
