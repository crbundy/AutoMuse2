yes. Pray read on.”        “‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her       ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual       condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it       became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on       the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what       she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give       the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her       noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run       hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’       Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin       Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only       concerned that their living together before the marriage took       place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect       the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement       at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as       soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and       had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously       have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a       Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their       names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of       Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his       dear Charlotte’s situation,
